        "description": "The ancient poet Sappho coined “sweetbitter” in one of her most evocative verses, still striking us to the heart nearly three millennia later. But who was Sappho? As with so many ancient figures, she is more legend than person today, her story told and retold even as her poetry continues to enchant and move us. Ranging from ancient Greece to seventeenth century France to twentieth century Britain, this exhibit will explore Sappho as poet, muse, and icon.The exhibit, Sweetbitter: The Literary Legacies and Afterlives of Sappho, will be on display in the RBML through May 2025.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "description": "Accurate, up-to-date delineation of hydrographic features is essential for hydrologic modeling, water-resource management, and disaster resilience. However, existing workflows for the U.S. National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) rely heavily on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and manual editing, limiting scalability, consistency, and timeliness of updates across various landscapes. This dissertation addresses the limitations of data-intensive hydrographic mapping—specifically in transferability, adaptability, and physical consistency—by developing a geospatial deep learning framework for scalable and automated hydrographic delineation through three interconnected studies.The first study addresses the limitation of transferability by leveraging transfer learning with convolutional neural networks pre-trained on ImageNet to improve streamline segmentation accuracy and generalization across heterogeneous landscapes. The second study tackles the challenge of adaptability through Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), enabling models to rapidly adjust to new geographic regions with minimal labeled data using Alaska’s IfSAR dataset.Building upon these advances, the final study addresses the issue of physical consistency by developing a multimodal, multitask deep learning framework that fuses DEM, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical, thermal, and learned embeddings to jointly predict streamlines and flow directions. This framework integrates complementary information sources to enforce topological coherence while enhancing scalability and robustness for continental-scale hydrographic mapping. Taken together, this dissertation advances an integrative, cyberGIS-enabled deep learning methodology that enhances the automation, transferability, and scalability of national hydrography production – laying the foundation for next-generation hydrographic data workflows and supporting intelligent environmental management.",

Priority will be given to student participants (undergraduate & graduate).______________________________________________Book description:Hopeful, groundbreaking, and anchored in true stories, this much-needed book from sexuality journalist and fellow sexual assault survivor Katie Simon delves into the challenges of moving from trauma to healing. Tell Me What You Like will guide sexual assault survivors toward the sex and relationships they want, and speaks to the shift in sexual culture we all need.Over a decade ago, Katie Simon began seeking out stories of people who faced sexual challenges after sexual trauma—just as she did. Simon interviewed dozens of survivors, and her investigation yielded diverse responses from people of all backgrounds, ultimately confirming that there is no single path toward healing.     Simon’s research led her to life-changing findings that sexual assault survivors most want to know about, including coping with trauma triggers and traumatic stress symptoms such as anxiety, depression, physical pain, and flashbacks. From embodied consent to self-pleasure, sexual regret, breakups, and beyond, you’ll find answers to all your questions about how sexual trauma affects sex and relationships within these pages, in stories told by survivors who’ve actually been there. Millions of survivors across the United States are treated as irreparably broken. Simon offers a positive approach to healing based on empathy and community—and the understanding and tools to navigate trauma and cultivate the sex lives we desire and deserve. The narratives Simon has gathered break down the potential obstacles to rebuilding post-assault, and offer multiple paths forward with optimistic, new approaches to sex after sexual assault. Packed with insights, stories, and advice, this invaluable guide reimagines what sex can look like—not only for survivors, but for all of us.",

        "title": "The Legal Value of Written Records for Jews and Christians in Medieval Provence",
        "description": "In fourteenth-century Provence, the volume of contracts produced by scribes known as public notaries increased rapidly from thousands each year to millions. By the fifteenth century, virtually all social and economic relations could be guaranteed by a notarial act. Reliance on the written word expanded both geographically and socially, reaching even the region's most remote rural communities and serving the interests of marginalized actors, including women, peasants, and religious minorities. This talk seeks to answer fundamental questions about this extraordinary moment in late medieval law, literacy, and technology: Why did written records become so wildly popular so quickly? What were the consequences of this rapid legal and cultural transformation? And how did the lives and logics of everyday legal actors change as a result? Prof. Ryan Low (University of North Dakota; PhD Harvard, 2024) researches the history of information and information technologies in the Mediterranean Middle Ages. Using the massive amounts of legal and bureaucratic documents produced by late medieval notaries in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, he studies the rapid expansion of the written word in the form of legal contracts, especially in late medieval Provence. He treats these practical written documents as a new information technology that radically transformed how individuals throughout the medieval Mediterranean produced and consumed information related to social life and economic exchange. These transformations did not impact everyone in medieval society in the same ways, and much of his research focuses on the effects of this late medieval phenomenon on Jews, women, peasants, and artisans. Prof. Low is also a project leader for The Documentary Archaeology of Late Medieval Europe, an international and interdisciplinary research project that collects, edits, and publishes lists of everyday objects recorded in late medieval household or estate inventories. He has edited dozens of archival manuscripts related to Jewish households, parish churches, and urban artisans. He has also contributed to the Historical Pharmacopeias Research Project which publishes lists of ingredients and medicaments found in pharmacies throughout Europe and the Western Hemisphere up to 1800.",

        "description": "Based on findings of a long-term ethnographic study of the integration and other experiences of Bosnians resettled as refugees to two urban environments in the north of New York State, this talk will suggest taking a long-term perspective in studying refugee integration. While the labels \"pre-resettlement\" and \"post-resettlement\" offer analytical convenience when examining this topic, it is helpful to recognize that the integrating individuals may not necessarily be operating on a logic that divides their lives in a \"before-and-after\" manner. Accordingly, the talk will invite attention to the ways in which integration experiences may exhibit a nonlinear or cyclical character. Factors such as difficulties of exit from the origin country and transit through subsequent countries later on may impact individual or collective decision-making in areas of, for instance, home buying in the permanent resettlement country. Likewise, the availability of transferable pre-migration soft & hard skills and capital may lead to variations in naturalization decisions, entrepreneurial activities, and community building initiatives of refugees who may otherwise be similarly positioned in terms of ethno-national-religious backgrounds, reasons for displacement, and types of assistance received, among other attributes.Fethi Keles, PT Instructor, Department of Anthropology, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University",

        "description": "This is a VIRTUAL only event with Dr. Se-Mi Oh. Professor Anna Jungeun Lee (EALC/History) will moderate the talk.About the Speaker:\"I am a cultural historian of modern and contemporary Korea who works across the disciplinary boundaries of urban humanities and visual studies. My research is concerned with the question of how history interacts with space. To be specific, I take the city as the subject of my study and also a method of doing history. This leads me to approach visual and textual manifestations of the city not as a reflection of historical reality but as constitutive of it. As I approach the city as the writing of history, I rely on semiotics in decoding space as language and text and employ interdisciplinary approaches of history, visual/media studies, urban humanities, and art and architecture.\"Read more about Dr. Se-Mi Oh at the link.About the Talk:Nodeul is a man-made island in the Han River that has become a focal point of urban planning debates in recent decades. Once a shifting river sandbank shaped by seasonal flooding, it was transformed into a permanent island in 1917, when the Japanese colonial government raised the bank and reinforced it with stone embankments as part of the Han River footbridge between Yongsan and Noryangjin. Long inconspicuous, Nodeul emerged into public attention in 2005, when Mayor Lee Myung-bak proposed building an opera house on the site. Under Oh Se-hoon, it was rebranded as the “Hangang Arts Island,” a plan abandoned after strong public opposition. Under Park Won-sun, it was reimagined as an urban farm and commons. Today, the Nodeul Dream Island project has brought the site back into the spotlight, with Thomas Heatherwick’s Soundscape winning the most recent international design competition.This presentation traces the shifting visions of Nodeul across these competing projects and asks what they reveal about the island’s status as an urban exception—a space persistently reimagined, yet never fully settled within Seoul’s urban landscape.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Free speech and academic freedom are foundational to our university’s missions of discovery and exploration.

Through community-engaged research including the Nmé restoration program and Elder’s meal program, I examine how Maamawijiwan—an Anishinaabe understanding of watersheds—offers an alternative framework for jurisdiction that centers Indigenous sovereignty and everyday practices of belonging.

Sponsored in part by an Urbana Arts & Culture Grant.This performance will be LIVE, but if you would like to join virtually, please click the \"Join online\" link in the top section.Sun, Nov 9th: 1:30pm at the Spurlock Museum of World Cultures, 600 S Gregory, UrbanaWhile this program is free, because there is limited seating at the Spurlock Museum, we are asking attendees to RSVP here: https://forms.gle/8Kh5H8N967DUf3MXAThe Turnaway Play is about what really happens when people are denied access to abortion. An urgent issue comes to life onstage through humor, drama, and audience participation. The play is inspired and informed by the groundbreaking Turnaway Study, conducted by Dr. Diana Greene Foster, a 2023 MacArthur Fellow and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Foster followed 1,000 women from across the country for ten years and obtained the first scientific results on the consequences people face when either having or being denied an abortion. The main finding of the Turnaway Study is that receiving an abortion does not harm the health and wellbeing of women, but in fact, being denied an abortion results in worse financial, health and family outcomes.Cast:June Clark EubanksElizabeth DrewsMaggie KinnamonCourtney Raymond-MalcolmErin RouxAndrea RundellMariana SedaKaila SimpsonHeather Smith-HolleyJamie TuckerCharacters in the play are based on Turnaway Study subjects and members of the research team. The play uses the words and experiences of these real people to bust myths and reduce abortion stigma. Drama, humor, and audience participation make it an engaging and thought-provoking theatrical event.",

That is where the EVERYbody Project comes in. This workshop is a body acceptance-based program designed to help students feel better about their bodies as we directly discuss the impact of diversity within cultural appearance ideals (including race, gender identity, sexuality, ability, and age) and critique the individual and collective impact of pursuing exclusive appearance norms. This research-based program has been shown to improve body satisfaction and acceptance among college students and reduce the risks of unhealthy eating behaviors, disordered eating, and eating disorders.The program entails two 90-minute sessions, scheduled one week apart, and is co-led by Counseling Center staff members, graduate assistants, and Counseling Center Paraprofessional undergraduate students. Each session is designed for groups of 6-12 students. To get the most out of the program, individual students and groups are asked to register only if they can attend both 90-minute sessions. As the name suggests, the EVERYbody Project is targeted toward EVERY type of body, meaning students can benefit regardless of gender identity, ethnicity, size, or ability.

        "description": "The 6.5 meter NASA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the near--mid-IR sequel  to Hubble, and was successfully launched from French Guiana on December 25, 2021  This talk summarizes the main and most dramatic discoveries by JWST: how  much cosmic star-formation has produced its own dust, and has been hidden in  its own dust. Webb has revealed the ``Cosmic Circle of Life'', where stars  and their planetary systems are formed in this environment of cosmic dust,  while stars return their own dust at the end of their lifetimes. In cosmic  perspective, the formation of the Sun and Earth occurred 4.5 billion years ago when other galaxies were already twice as old!  In random deep fields and Webb's stunning deep lensing galaxy cluster fields,  the earliest galaxies have been detected up to redshifts z=14 and beyond, when  the universe was barely 300 Myr old. Supermassive black hole growth may have started even before that time --- often shrouded by dust perhaps produced by  Population III stars --- and triggered surrounding galaxy formation through  powerful outflows that include relativistic jets. (Supermassive) black hole growth has very nicely kept up with the process of galaxy assembly, with  possible consequences for the nature of Dark Energy.  Very high redshift galaxies --- lensed through massive galaxy clusters up to  half the Hubble time in distance --- are being imaged by Webb at light year  scales --- physical scales not resolvable without lensing. Perhaps even more stunning, individual stars are now being discovered in significant numbers at  very high magnification (mu~1000--10,000) up to redshifts z~6 when going across the cluster caustics, constraining the the stellar mass function directly, and perhaps also the nature of (Wave) Dark Matter. Finally, Webb has detected some lensed high redshift multiply-imaged Supernovae (SNe), whose relativistic time delay helped address the Hubble tension.",

The tournament uses soccer as a medium to foster community engagement and promote language maintenance. It also serves as a vital space for younger members of the diaspora, born or raised in North America, to connect with their heritage. (Directed and Produced by Mirshad Ghalip and David Tobin. 2024. USA. 43 minutes.)About the Filmmaker:Mirshad Ghalip is a linguistic anthropologist whose research examines language, memory, and survival in the Uyghur diaspora. He holds a Ph.D. in Anthropology from Indiana University, where his dissertation, Uyghur Realities: Genocide in the Homeland, Survival in the Diaspora, combined autoethnographic, qualitative, and quantitative methods to analyze how state violence and displacement reshape language ideologies and cultural continuity among Uyghurs in North America. His work has appeared in Made in China Journal and other scholarly venues. He is also the director of Echoes of Home (2024), a documentary film exploring how Uyghur diasporic communities in North America cultivate belonging through collective rituals such as soccer.",

        "description": "This talk follows the remarkable afterlife of a lie: the accusation that the Jews of Brussels desecrated the Eucharistic Host in 1370. From its thin medieval traces, the story grew into a grand civic myth, told through paintings, processions, and stained glass, that came to define Brussels' religious and urban identity for centuries. Dr. Cassen explores how this legend was used to serve both church and state, and how even after the Holocaust, efforts at reconciliations stopped short of confronting its falsehood. In tracing the evolution of one fabricated story, we'll consider what happens when myth becomes history- and whether it is possible to undo that transformation.",

        "description": "The RBML is thrilled to host Gillen D’Arcy Wood, who will speak about his new book, The Wake of HMS Challenger: How a Legendary Victorian Voyage Tells the Story of Our Oceans' Decline. Copies of the book will be available for purchase and signing. This event is free and open to the public, and refreshments will be served.In December 1872, HMS Challenger embarked on the first round-the-world oceanographic expedition. Its goal: to shine a light for the first time on the mysteries of the deep sea. For the next four years, Challenger’s naturalists explored the oceans, encountering never-before-seen marvels of marine life. The expedition’s achievements are the stuff of legend. It identified major ocean currents and defining features of the seafloor, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Mariana Trench. It measured worldwide sea temperatures and chemistry, creating baseline data for all ocean research since. And, most spectacularly of all, it collected nearly five thousand sea creatures and plants new to science. In The Wake of HMS Challenger, Gillen D’Arcy Wood looks afresh at this legendary scientific odyssey and shows why, 150 years later, its legacy looms larger than ever.The Challenger’s scientists had no way of knowing that the incredible undersea aquarium they were documenting was on the verge of catastrophic change. Off Portugal, they encountered a brilliant starfish now threatened with extinction by microplastics; in St. Thomas, teeming coral habitats that today have been decimated by ocean warming; and at remote Ascension Island, the breeding grounds of the now-endangered green turtle. Lyrical and elegiac, The Wake of HMS Challenger offers a stunning before-and-after picture of our global oceans. It is both a reminder of what we have lost since the Victorian age and an urgent call to preserve what remains of the diverse life and wild beauty of our planet’s final frontier.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

In this new research project, Prof. Handman explores the different ways that AI is transforming our ideas about language and humanness by seeing how people are imagining some kind of AI-enabled interspecies communication. How are animals-as-speakers getting folded into democratic, legal, and even economic systems? People who are interested in interspecies communication range from animal behaviorists, to Silicon Valley investors, to members of the public. One of the current challenges of the project is how to describe this world of interspecies communication in a way that pays close attention to the diverse forms of participation in it.",

        "description": "A Special Presentation by Josh Harris, Kim Schmidt, and Abigail Bobrow             What happens when writers, archivists, and preservationists join forces? At the University of Illinois, this partnership transforms ordinary records into stories that bridge generations. Writers capture the immediacy of campus life through interviews, profiles, and features while archivists and preservationists safeguard context, accuracy, and continuity. Together, they ensure that today’s voices remain accessible tomorrow.This session highlights how collaboration strengthens storytelling. We’ll explore how writers can draw from archival collections to enrich narratives, how archivists prepare today’s materials for future researchers, and how preservationists keep fragile or digital content from being lost. The conversation will emphasize strategies that balance creativity with stewardship, showing how each role supports the other.Examples include using rare photographs to inspire and illustrate contemporary feature stories, capturing oral histories before memories fade, and creating digital repositories that meet both communications needs and scholarly standards. These efforts demonstrate how short-term storytelling can build long-term institutional memory.By valuing both creativity and preservation, universities can ensure their stories endure. Attendees will leave with ideas for fostering partnerships that not only document the present but also preserve it for the future.Josh Harris is the head of Media Preservation since its inception in 2011 within the University Library. Josh oversees the preservation of the library’s sound recordings, motion picture films, and videotapes through conservation, preservation, and digitization. Josh is also secretary-general for the Southeast Asia-Pacific Audiovisual Archive Association.Kim Schmidt is the storytelling director in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement, responsible for overseeing creative content produced for donors and friends. She is the founding editor of STORIED magazine. Kim received her master’s degree in journalism from Illinois in 2017.Abigail Bobrow is the associate director of storytelling in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement. She is responsible for creating stories, videos, and photography for STORIED, a campus-level print magazine and website. Abigail also serves as the chair of the University of Illinois Web Conference, a two-day virtual event that brings together web professionals from around the world. Abigail received her master’s degree in journalism from the University of Illinois in 2019.",

        "description": "In Circulations, Courtney Handman examines the surprising continuities in the ways that modernist communications discourses shaped both colonial and decolonial projects in Papua New Guinea. Often described as a place with too many mountains and too many languages to be modern, Papua New Guinea was seen as a space of circulatory primitivity—where people, things, and talk could not move. Colonial missionaries and administrators, and even anticolonial delegations of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, argued that this circulatory primitivity could be overcome only through the management of communication infrastructures, bureaucratic information flows, and the introduction of English. Innovatively bringing together analyses of radios, airplanes, telepathy, bureaucracy, and lingua francas, Circulations argues for the critical role of communicative networks and communicative imaginaries in political processes of colonialism and decolonization worldwide.About the Author: Courtney Handman is the author of Critical Christianity: Translation and Denominational Conflict in Papua New Guinea (University of California Press). She is Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin, where she teaches about language, media, and the religious and political forms of circulation. This event is sponsored by Anthropology and The Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies (CEAPS).",

        "description": "A Time for the Province proposes innovative readings of historical and contemporary Polish borderlands as a complex dialogic zone, offering new ways of connecting the Polish past(s) with the country’s present and its future. Across seven chapters, as the study dives into narratives by some of Poland’s most iconic modern authors, including the 2018 Nobel Laureate Olga Tokarczuk, it engages with fields of memory and postmemory studies, postsocialist studies, Holocaust history, Jewish-Polish relations, and ethnic and migration studies. Drawing on writings of such contemporary Polish critics as Przemysław Czapliński and Krzysztof Czyżewski, postcolonial theorists including Homi Bhabha and Edward Said, and philosophers of the human environment such as Gaston Bachelard, A Time for the Province revises and complicates traditional conceptions of what the province and the borderland represent and perform within Polish literary and cultural practice, reframing this space as both a contact zone and a palimpsest.George Gasyna is Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures and Comparative and World Literature at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and editor in chief of the Slavic & East European Journal (SEEJ). Born in Łódź, Poland, he and his family emigrated to Ontario, Canada – home of one of the largest and most vibrant Polish diasporas in North America – when he was 12. Prof. Gasyna holds a BA and an MA in Russian and Slavic Studies from McGill University in Montreal, and a PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of Toronto (2005). Specializing in Polish literature of the 20th century, his work engages with a number of adjacent fields including émigré and exilic discourses, heritage and diaspora studies, and Polish-Jewish relations, as well as travel writing and memoir. Prof. Gasyna is author of Polish, Hybrid, and Otherwise: Exilic Discourse in Joseph Conrad and Witold Gombrowicz (London: Bloomsbury, 2011), and editor for the volume of essays Joseph Conrad’s Polish Soul: Realms of Memory and Self (2016). His scholarship has appeared in a number of critical collections and journals including Slavic Review, Canadian Slavonic Papers, Polish Review, and Russian Literature. His most recent book, A Time for the Province: Palimpsests and Borders in Twentieth-Century Polish Literature, was published in spring 2025 by McGill-Queen's University Press.",

        "description": "Join us for a CEAPS Brown Bag with PhD student Conference Travel Grant recipients Jiwon Oh and Darren ChuangAbout the SpeakersJiwon Jenn Oh is a PhD Student at the University of Illinois in the Institute of Communications Research. Her research interests broadly encompass transnational and feminist STS, AI ethics and governance, and East Asian technocultures, with a particular focus on the cultural and political life of AI and how discourses of innovation, intimacy, and governance are entangled in the production of relational AI. She holds an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication from New York University. Darren (Sheng-Hsuan) Chuang is a second-year PhD student in Musicology at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. His research lies at the intersection of ethnomusicology, popular music studies, Taiwan and East Asian studies, and gender studies. He is particularly interested in how Taiwanese popular music both reflects and shapes expressions of Taiwanese masculinities, especially as they intersect with class, cultural identity, and national discourses within broader East Asian and global contexts. Before pursuing his PhD at U of I, he earned his BA in Chinese Literature from National Cheng Kung University (Taiwan), a dual MA in Arts and Humanities Education and Musicology from Taipei National University of the Arts (Taiwan), and an MPhil in Music Studies from Wolfson College, University of Cambridge (United Kingdom). About \"Navigating Gendered Anthropomorphism in AI Ethics”The Lee Luda controversy was a pivotal moment that inaugurated nationwide discourses surrounding AI ethics in South Korea. As a conversational chatbot designed to simulate lifelike conversations, Luda quickly gained attention for its human-like interaction capabilities but soon became the center of controversy due to its use of private human conversations for training, leading to unintended disclosures of personal details and generating responses filled with hate speech and sexual content manipulation. This incident prompted widespread public concern and regulatory scrutiny, leading to suspension of the service and subsequent fines imposed by the government. In response, ScatterLab introduced an ‘AI Chatbot Ethics Checklist’ to address ethical concerns in AI development. This study examines the aftermath of the Lee Luda incident, focusing on ScatterLab’s ethical response and the broader implications for AI ethics and gender in Korea, underscoring the need for inclusive and ethical AI design practices to mitigate biases in AI technologies. About \"Sailing in Sonic Vortex: Close Listening to Taike Tunes in Taiwan’s Post-Martial Law Music Scene\"Taiwan possesses a unique and fluid sociocultural landscape that shapes its musical sphere into a “sonic vortex.” Since the post-martial law era, amid processes of internal sociocultural opening, transformation, and contestation, as well as shifting geopolitics and accelerating globalization, Taiwanese popular music has gained renewed momentum, intricately weaving together diverse cultural symbols and emerging through interconnections with musical flows from East Asia and beyond. Against this backdrop, this paper examines how Taiwanese music articulates both inter-Asian connections and a localized form of globality, while also demonstrating how it reflects, and even participates in, Taiwan’s complex history of successive colonial regimes. Focusing on case studies that vocalize taike / 8+9 culture—a subculture renowned for its performances of distinct Taiwanese masculinities and expressions of Taiwaneseness—I approach music as a multilayered text of verbal, sonic, and visual symbols, employing musical semiotics in dialogue with inter-Asian studies and global history. In doing so, through the analysis of both verbal and non-verbal symbols, I aim to reposition the musical object itself—the sound—as an indispensable component of popular music studies. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Free speech and academic freedom are foundational to our university’s missions of discovery and exploration.

        "title": "GGIS Colloquium | Material Intelligence: Mapping as Design",
        "description": "This lecture explores material intelligence—a way of thinking through making that links design practice to the study of maps, media, and material culture. The concept emerges from my research on nineteenth-century panoramic cartography, including the 1820 Circular View from Mount Rigi, and from a broader inquiry into how graphic media act as instruments of embodied knowledge. The Rigi map translated the act of turning on a mountain summit into a circular diagram of national space, aligning visual system with bodily sensation. Its design choreographed movement, touch, and perception, transforming geography into an immersive experience that carried political meaning in post-Napoleonic Switzerland, where shared visibility served as a metaphor for unity. I build on this historical example to describe and theorize material intelligence within traditions of material-culture studies that treat artifacts as agents of thought and inquiry. Makerly processes—replication, reconstruction, and re-invention—can serve as modes of research as well as creative practice. In this framework, making informs research and research informs making, revealing how graphic and cartographic design mediate between perception and world.Classroom projects extend these principles through a three-phase sequence: producing a 1:1 study facsimile, re-creating the artifact to grasp its logic through analog and digital tools, and inventing new works that evolve from that tactile collaboration. These iterative engagements transform archives into laboratories of spatial imagination, demonstrating how digital fabrication and interactive print can reactivate historical media for contemporary learning. Connecting nineteenth-century mapping to twenty-first-century design pedagogy reframes cartography as a design practice that produces—not merely represents—social and spatial realities. Material intelligence emerges as both a research method and a pedagogical ethos for investigating how visual artifacts shape ways of seeing, knowing, and belonging in the world.",

        "description": "Did you know the internet runs on light?Every time you send an email or stream a video, bright pulses of light travel through underground fiber-optic cables — the invisible highways of the internet. These light pulses carry the 1s and 0s that computers use to store and share information.Now, imagine doing this with individual particles of light, called photons. That’s the idea behind a quantum network. Instead of just sending data, quantum networks use the strange and powerful rules of quantum mechanics — the science of how the universe behaves at the tiniest scales.In a quantum network, photons can be entangled, meaning they behave like a single connected system even when separated by great distances. Changing or measuring one instantly influences the other. Researchers around the world are exploring how this property can power next-generation communication systems and connect emerging quantum technologies like quantum computers and sensors.With the Public Quantum Network (PQN), we want everyone — not just scientists — to be part of this new frontier. PQN brings entangled photons to public spaces such as libraries and schools using the same fiber-optic cables that already carry the internet.The first section of the Public Quantum Network launched at The Urbana Free Library in 2023. This presentation will take you behind the scenes of how it was built and share ongoing efforts to make the network reliable, interactive, and open source — so anyone can explore the quantum internet of the future.",

Join her on an adventure across time and the tools of history to re-discover the women of the ancient world.Copies of Hauser's recent books Penelope’s Bones: A New History of Homer’s World through the Women Written Out of It and How Women Became Poets: A Gender History of Greek Literature will be available onsite for purchase and signing.

Nevertheless, the case for arms control principles and tools remains strong. Despite arguments that the world has entered a new nuclear age, it is in all of our best interest to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in international security and work toward their eventual elimination. The argument in favor of restraint, diplomacy, and risk reduction is as valid as ever, and the fields of arms control and nonproliferation need new talent. Could that be you? Find out what role you can play.John Erath John Erath is the Senior Policy Director for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, overseeing the policy team and guiding work on issues including Iran, Russia, North Korea, China, U.S. domestic nuclear policy and more.

        "description": "Join us for a lecture in the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age Speaker Series with Tara Isabella Burton. God-making: Magic and Transhumanism from the Renaissance to the Digital AgeAre we building God? In an era where artificial intelligence and the ubiquity of the Internet age renders the realm of information more present -- and real-feeling -- than the physical one, how do we understand ourselves theologically? And, no less importantly, how do we understand our relationship to reality? This talk will explore contemporary transhumanism -- from human self-transcendence to the rise of artificial intelligence -- as a specifically theological phenomenon, one rooted in the symbol set, rhetoric, and sacralization of the human found in the Western esoteric tradition. Often considered under the catch-all term \"magic,\" or \"learned magic,\" these schools of thought -- rooted in late antique Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Hermeticism, and frequently revived by scientists and humanists from Marsilio Ficino to Isaac Newton -- stress the necessity of human beings using gnosis to become Gods and perhaps even transcend their creature. This lecture will show the perennial influence of these ideas at various stages of what we now think of as \"modernity\", as well as their impact, in particular, on the twentieth-century counterculture that gave rise to the Internet.     About the SpeakerTara Isabella Burton is the author of Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World, Self-Made: Creating Our Identities from Da Vinci to the Kardashians, and the novels Social Creature, The World Cannot Give, and Here in Avalon. About the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital AgeHoused in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age supports study and research into the possibilities for human flourishing in contemporary society.The activities of the Forum combine philosophical reflection on human nature and the human good with practical reflection on the possibilities for living well, and for designing tools that contribute to human flourishing, in a world shaped by digital technology.

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.  For International Education Week, we are pleased to showcase ryūrei tea ceremony in the spirit of international collaboration.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available. Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. Thank you for your understanding.",

        "description": "This research visually represents the impact of agrarian systems on environmental, epidemiological, and economic indicators in the Brazilian Amazon since 2000. Utilizing the Trajetórias dataset, which spans 17 years of environmental, epidemiological, and socioeconomic indicators for all municipalities in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, the study provides a set of maps and an interactive visualization accessible via a public website called \"Amazon Views.\" Drawing on multi-layered experimental data visualization techniques, the interactive cartographies create conceptual spaces that enable users to explore and visually correlate indicators across indicators. The cartographies serve as a valuable resource for researchers and the general public to monitor environmental and social trends, thus facilitating a deeper understanding of the relationships between climate, health, and population changes.  Dr. Juan Salamanca, Associate Professor in the School of Art and Design at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, investigates how social and material conditions foster or hinder cooperative and collaborative social practices. His research employs data visualization and agent-based modeling to examine how design influences attaining unexpected collective goals.",

After the film, filmmakers Heesun Shin and Chihyung Jeon will virtually join us for an audience Q&A.  We hope to see you there!About the Film:In South Korea, thousands of older adults are living with Hyodol, a doll-shaped robot with electronic sensors and communication modules. Following the journey of Hyodol from its production to use, Hug Me Tight: A Robot Story shows how the meaning of care is changing in the age of robots. Featuring members of the robot company, care workers who bring the robots to users, and older adults who interact with the robots daily, the film asks important questions for our age: Can robots take care of older adults? Can older adults take care of the robot? How should we take care of each other?Film run time is 61 minutes.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Free speech and academic freedom are foundational to our university’s missions of discovery and exploration.

        "description": "Join us for a lecture in the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age Speaker Series with Matthew DeCamp.Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: More than a Tool We UseFrom predictive algorithms to ambient notetaking, generative replies to patients, and more, artificial intelligence (AI) is already influencing medicine. How should we approach this radical transformation? Drawing on insights from medical practice, philosophy, and the social sciences (including ongoing research studies on AI-based prognostication and patient-facing chatbots), this talk will argue that AI is more than a “tool we use.” It has the potential to change who we are, and what we value. In response, ethical principles alone are not enough; instead, cultivating virtues in this new AI age will be critical to addressing issues of transparency, explainability, algorithmic bias, and more.      About the SpeakerMatthew DeCamp, MD, PhD, is a practicing internist, philosopher and social scientist whose research on ethics and artificial intelligence bridges the gaps between ethics, medicine, and health policy. He is an associate professor of Internal Medicine at the Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado.About the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital AgeHoused in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age supports study and research into the possibilities for human flourishing in contemporary society.The activities of the Forum combine philosophical reflection on human nature and the human good with practical reflection on the possibilities for living well, and for designing tools that contribute to human flourishing, in a world shaped by digital technology.

We will not meet on campus holidays.This event will be held in a hybrid format: Join us in-person in the Main Library Orange Room. Or, join us online.

Students are encouraged to begin application drafts prior to leaving for winter break.  The Boren provides study abroad scholarships of up to $25,000 for a full academic year or $12,500 for a semester. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students also have the option of applying for summer-only programs of eight weeks or more. All scholarships may be used for U.S. citizens to study in Asia, Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East on almost any study abroad program. These are merit-based scholarships (approximately 1 in 5 eligible applicants receive awards). In order to receive the scholarship, award winners must enter into a service agreement requiring that they attempt to work in a paid position for the federal government in an area related to national security—generally the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, or the Intelligence Community within three years of graduation (deferrals possible/encouraged for graduate study). Working for USAID or tenure in the Peace Corps counts in the service requirement. Winners also receive priority-hiring status.  For more information, contact the scholarships office at topscholars@illinois.edu or visit our website at Boren Scholarship – National & International Scholarships Program",

Through films, photographs, and installations, Angie Bonilla traces how Latinx visual practices expose the racial politics of visibility and imagine endurance and solidarity beyond cages, beyond crisis. Bridging hemispheric, aesthetic, and political frameworks, her talk reimagines how migration is seen, felt, and governed across the Americas.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "description": "vanessa german is a leading citizen artist working in sculpture, performance, and communal ritual to cultivate spiritual models for transforming human experience. Establishing her own self-taught approach and distinctive artistic language, german’s influential practice employs mineral crystals, beads, glass, found objects, and other sourced material to create expressive figurative sculptures that resound through the physical and metaphysical worlds. Her unique sculptural vocabulary transmits healing energy, affirming the power of love as an infinite human technology. Channeling precolonial and African diasporic traditions, her figures allude to the Kongo nkisi nkondi, each charged by the protective and restorative spirits that complement their physical materials. Guided by her own creativity, imagination and curiosity, german follows her intuition about the capacity for objects to tell stories, creating sculptures that resonate deeply with those who encounter them.The artist’s practice is intertwined with her history of activism and community leadership. Crediting her mother, the fiber artist Sandra Keat German, with inspiring her sense of creative purpose, german realized her first power figures on the front porch of her home, where she would invite neighbors to join her. She would soon found the arts initiative Love Front Porch in 2011 before establishing ARThouse, combining a community studio and artist residency for her neighbors, in 2014. german has received numerous accolades over the course of her career, including the Joyce Foundation Fellowship (2024), Heinz Award for the Arts (2022), Don Tyson Prize from the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (2018), United States Artist Grant (2018), Jacob Lawrence Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2017) and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Grant (2015).",

        "description": "Dr. Tanveer Singh joined the Chung lab in April 2024.The Chung laboratory is interested in understanding how ion channels and their dynamic regulation modulate neuronal excitability, communications, and plasticity in the brain.Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that generate electric current by mediating the flow of ions across the plasma membrane in morphologically and functionally distinct neuronal compartments called axons and dendrites. Axons generate and propagate action potentials whereas dendrites receive them at inter-cellular junctions called synapses where synaptic transmissions (communications) occur between neurons.Ion channel dysregulation is involved in a wide variety of neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. In Chung lab, we focus on epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Epilepsy is a common chronic brain disorder caused by excessive brain activity clinically characterized as seizures, which are abnormal and uncontrolled discharges of electrical signals in the brain cells called neurons. Drug-resistant seizures have severe consequences including cognitive decline, high mortality rate, psychiatric disorders, neurodevelopmental delay, and brain damage. Hence, better understanding of the pathogenesis of epilepsy is critical to develop novel therapeutic interventions and early diagnostics for epilepsy. A fundamental question is “how do neurons change themselves to produce excessive electrical signals in an epileptic brain compared to a normal brain?”",

        "description": "Abstract: Fermi surfaces have a number of fascinating properties, including a continuum of gapless excitations, a landscape of possible collective modes, universal super-area law entanglement, and relevant deformations that can produce non-Fermi liquid quantum critical metals. Their extreme gaplessness makes them difficult to tame with the conventional tools of QFT. Bosonization provides a potential nonperturbative approach by describing Fermi surface dynamics through a collective field living on a part of phase space. However, while such a field is sensible semiclassically, the challenge of treating it quantum mechanically has prevented bosonization from providing as powerful a tool as in one dimension. I will show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a particular large N limit of a U(N)_1 WZW model, with a tower of irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom in the collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches.",

To effectively assimilate, store, and retrieve relevant information, emerging technologies now enable more natural and intuitive interaction with digital media, enhancing both efficiency and immersion. In this talk, I will present recent work on multichannel and multidimensional haptic displays that augment user experience—allowing users to feel stories through semantic cues in natural language, manipulate virtual objects with varying compliance and dynamic properties, and mitigate cybersickness through spatial haptics applied to the body. Haptic feedback not only extends the communication bandwidth between users and their digital content but also opens new modes of information exchange in immersive storytelling and virtual environments.Bio: ALI ISRAR (PhD) is a technology leader, inventor, scientist and an engineer. Over the last 25 years Ali has conducted research and development with Haptics Feedback Technologies at the forefront of industry with ByteDance, Meta and Disney. Ali had managed research and product innovation teams, managed end-to-end development of core hardware and software modules from initial idea to executing deployment strategies, and demonstrated product graded experiences in exhibitions and companywide promotion campaigns. Ali has over 100 scientific publications and more than 30 granted patents.This is an in-person event. Refreshments will be provided.",

The app integrates counseling and sound therapy, with educational videos, personalized sound stimuli, and an expert-controlled web panel. In our pilot study, adults with these conditions showed significant improvement in symptom measures after six weeks of use (p < .05). User and expert feedback also highlighted the app’s usability and potential as an accessible rehabilitation tool. Rohit Ananthanarayana, Ph.D. Student Children’s Ability to Use Extended High-Frequency and Head Orientation Cues for Auditory Scene Analysis In realistic listening scenarios where a target talker faces a listener while masker talkers typically face other directions, listeners may receive less masker energy at extended high frequencies (EHFs; >8 kHz) due to directional propagation of EHFs. This leads to unmasking of target EHF cues, which could help listeners identify the target talker. Children’s greater sensitivity at EHFs and reliance on greater signal bandwidth could make EHF cues especially useful for children. In this talk I will present preliminary findings from a study where adult and child listeners were tested on their sensitivity to the relative head orientations of talkers in a multi-talker scene.",

        "description": "Join us for a lecture from Tempest Henning, an associate professor at Fisk University. Beyond Rejection and Reform: Toward a Black Feminist LogicI argue that the dominant rejectionist and reformist feminist logical projects, while aptly critiquing classical logic, fail to confront how logic is also racialized. In asking the question ‘Whose feminist logic are we building?’ I offer a conception of Black feminist logic (BFL) that is not simply a variant of feminist logic. Rather, it is founded on distinct systems rooted in African logical traditions and manifested via the linguistic structures of African American English (AAE). I critique the rejectionist stance (Nye 1990) for incorrectly universalizing all logics as a ‘master’s tool.’ This is exemplified through the conception of ‘nommo,’ which is a logical system that is communal and spiritual. The reformist project (Plumwood 1993), although useful in the analysis of dualism, I show to be inadequate because it inherently still draws upon a bivalent framework. Such a framework has difficulty accounting for practices like negative concord in AAE, where multiple negations function not as logical cancellation, but as emphatic assertion. Both ‘nommo’ and negative concord within AAE reveal that a BFL is one that is context-dependent as opposed to strictly truth-functional.",

        "description": "Please join this two part seminar. All are welcome to stay after the seminar for informal networking with the the center team.MASTERS: Multisensory VR Environments to Train First Responders under Emotional StressThe MASTERS project brings together a transdisciplinary consortium spanning computer science, HCI, mechanics, philosophy, cognitive sciences, and medicine to design innovative training methods for first responders (law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical staff, etc.). Its central goal is to support them in maintaining self-control under high-stress conditions, whether the constraints are psychological, social, or situational.Building on field studies, the project aims to develop a multisensory, immersive, and collaborative VR training program that realistically simulates socio-emotional situations. The presentation will first provide an overview of the project and its methodological approach before turning to the key challenges in designing such environments, including interpersonal haptic interactions, user representations, and interactions with virtual agents, elements that are critical to ensuring realism and training efficiency.Speaker:Amine Chellali received his M.Sc. in Robotics from École Centrale de Nantes (France) in 2005 and his Ph.D. in HCI from the University of Nantes (France) in 2009. From 2009 to 2011, he worked as a research assistant at the IRCCyN Lab. He then moved to the U.S. to work as a postdoctoral associate at Tufts University in the EREL Lab from 2011 to 2012 and then as a research associate in the ISSyL lab at Harvard Medical School. Currently, he is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Evry Paris-Saclay (France) and co-leader of the Interaction, Mixed Reality, and Assistive Robotics (IRA2) research group at the IBISC Lab. His research interests include Simulator fidelity, Haptic interactions, Collaborative virtual environments, and the transfer and evaluation of human skills. The main applications are in the field of medical training. He has received several grants for his research on VR simulation from the French National Research Agency and other national funding sources. Emotion Analysis and Empathic Adaptation in Immersive Scenarios: Toward Ethically Informed Human Understanding and EngagementThis research first explores the use of adaptive immersive scenarios to enhance human understanding and engagement in different contexts. The models combine ontologies, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) to produce stressful scenarios for training first responders. These scenarios are personalized according to each user’s profile, accounting for individual vulnerabilities—such as empathy, sensitivity to authority, or stress triggers—to create ethically informed and effective experiences.Building on this concept of user-centered scenario design, the ITS-STORY project investigates the use of mixed reality to foster historical empathy. Focusing on the Royallieu Camp Memorial in Compiègne, the project examines how immersive technologies can renew public engagement with the history of internment and deportation during the Second World War. Among the projects's objectives is the adaptation of immersive scenarios to participants' empathic responses, enabling personalized and ethically sensitive experiences that foster deeper historical understanding while avoiding exaggerated emotional engagement.Within this framework, the research focuses on the detection and quantification of empathy through facial emotion recognition using computer vision and machine learning. The aim is to understand whether empathic responses—elicited by historically grounded virtual scenarios—can be inferred from emotional cues. Building on multiple iterations of facial emotion recognition models, the work has evolved toward explainable approaches, combining deep learning architectures with SHAP-based interpretability analyses.This presentation addresses the adaptive design of scenarios according to user responses, details the methodological framework for measuring empathy through facial emotion analysis, and discusses ongoing challenges in linking emotional and empathic responses in immersive memorial environments. Together, these initiatives highlight the potential of personalized immersive experiences to enhance both professional training and public engagement and demonstrate how measuring emotional and empathic responses can inform ethically sensitive scenario design.Speakers:Domitile Lourdeaux is Full Professor at the CNRS Heudiasyc UMR 7253 laboratory at the Université de technologie de Compiègne UTC – Alliance Sorbonne University.

In this seminar, I will present new experimental results on the gluonic GFFs, focusing on the J/ψ-007 experiment in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. The complete J/ψ-007 dataset, including di-muon events, provides unprecedented access to the gluon GFFs and reveals how gluons exert and balance forces that stabilize the nucleon.  I will also discuss a new perspective on what the “size” of the proton means. In addition, I will summarize the experimental status of valence-quark GFFs and introduce an upcoming program to measure strange-quark GFFs via near-threshold φ electroproduction.

        "description": "Speaker: Arthur Parzygnat (MIT)Title: Using quantum Bayes’ rule to infer the causal structure of quantum experimentsAbstract: The state of a quantum system at a given time is described by a density matrix. From the density matrix, one can calculate expectation values of measurements of observables. Is there an operator that encodes sequential measurements of a quantum system evolving from one time step to another? How is this operator different from a bipartite density operator? If one only has access to the expected values of the measurement outcomes, can we deduce whether those measurements occurred in succession or on two separate parts of a single bipartite system? Provocatively, can you tell whether there is an arrow of time based only on measurement statistics? How is the answer to this question different from what can be predicted assuming only classical probability? I will try to answer as many of these questions as time permits and in a way that is mostly accessible to those who learned introductory quantum physics.This talk is based primarily on the papers https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17555 (joint with James Fullwood) and https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14278 (joint with Minjeong Song), along with earlier work establishing a quantum Bayes’ rule https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.020334 (joint with James Fullwood). About: Weekly seminar of the Quantum Working Group, covering topics in quantum information theory and operator algebras.

        "description": "Abstract: Many-body quantum systems subject to both driving and dissipation are ubiquitous, and often possess complex steady states that do not have a simple thermal-equilibrium form.  I’ll discuss how a subtle kind of quantum detailed balance (what we call “hidden time-reversal symmetry” (hTRS)) can yield exact insights into a range of different driven-dissipative quantum systems, including many-body systems relevant to a variety of experimental platforms.  The symmetry can also provide a powerful starting point for engineering dissipative dynamics that stabilizes non-trivial states.  I’ll discuss how hTRS lets us exactly describe a surprising non-equilibrium phase transition in a driven XXZ spin chain, and how it lets us design a cavity-QED compatible dynamics that can stabilize a host of non-trivial entangled states (including states that enable noise-robust quantum metrology, and states with SPT order).   Bio: Aashish Clerk’s research focuses on understanding complex phenomena in quantum systems that are both strongly driven and subject to dissipation. Such effects are not only interesting from a fundamental perspective, but can also enable quantum technologies to transcend the limitations of purely classical systems. His group’s work intersects the fields of condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and quantum information.Prof. Clerk received his B.Sc. in 1996 from the University of Toronto and a PhD in Physics from Cornell University in 2001. He worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University until 2004 when he joined the faculty at McGill University and concurrently served as a Canada Research Chair. Clerk joined the University of Chicago as a faculty member in 2017.Clerk’s honors include being appointed a Simons Investigator in Theoretical Physics in 2020, as well as receiving a Sloan Research Fellowship, an E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship from Canada’s National Science and Engineering Research Council, the Rutherford Memorial Medal in Physics from the Royal Society of Canada, and a Simons Foundation Fellowship in Theoretical Physics. To watch online, go to the IQUIST YouTube channel:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzAySwQXF8J4kRolUzg2ww",

However, experimentally testing all relevant combinations of cell types, chemicals, and doses for regulatory purposes is a daunting task. We have developed scVIDR, a deep generative learning-based tool to predict single-cell gene expression perturbations induced by chemical pollutants and drugs. scVIDR is able to accurately predict dose-dependent gene expression changes across cell types in mouse liver, human blood cells, and cancer cell lines. I will also present our work on quantitative analysis of perturbations in spatiotemporal gene expression patterns in the mammalian liver induced under exposure to environmental pollutants and during liver disease.Biography: Dr. Sudin Bhattacharya is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Pharmacology & Toxicology, as well as the Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, at Michigan State University. He leads a lab conducting research at the interface of computation and biology, studying the gene regulatory networks that underline cell fate choice and its perturbation by environmental pollutants. His current work focuses on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis in the context of cell fate choice and tissue architecture. Dr. Bhattacharya earned his undergraduate degree at Jadavpur University, India; his master’s degree at the University of Kentucky; and his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan.",

        "description": "In this talk sponsored by the Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Gillen D’Arcy Wood will speak about his new book, \"The Wake of HMS Challenger: How a Legendary Victorian Voyage Tells the Story of Our Oceans' Decline.\"In December 1872, HMS Challenger embarked on the first round-the-world oceanographic expedition, and for the next four years, Challenger’s naturalists explored the oceans, encountering never-before-seen marvels of marine life. They identified major ocean currents and defining features of the seafloor; they measured worldwide sea temperatures and chemistry, creating baseline data for all ocean research since. And, most spectacularly of all, they collected nearly five thousand sea creatures and plants new to science. They had no way of knowing that the incredible undersea aquarium they were documenting was on the verge of catastrophic change. Wood looks afresh at this legendary scientific odyssey and shows why, 150 years later, its legacy looms larger than ever. His book offers a stunning before-and-after picture of our global oceans — a reminder of what we have lost since the Victorian age and an urgent call to preserve what remains of the diverse life and wild beauty of our planet’s final frontier. Copies of the book will be available for purchase and signing.

        "description": "This study explores the role of critical thinking in fostering resistance to misinformation and its influence on intentions to verify information and share content on social media. Using a national survey (N=928) in the U.S., the findings indicate that individuals with strong critical thinking skills are more likely to verify information they encounter on social media and less likely to share unverified content. These relationships are mediated by greater perceived threat of misinformation and more positive attitudes toward fact-checking. The results highlight the significance of cultivating critical thinking skills as a key strategy to strengthen public resilience against misinformation. Here is a little bit about Dr. Sang-Hwa Oh:  https://media.illinois.edu/oh-sang-hwa/Feel free to bring a brown bag lunch!",

        "description": "Even in the time of streaming and industrial big-data, the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider still produce data of staggering size and rate. To combat this, low-level detector information is often removed, reduced, or recast; however, the lowest-level detector information holds exciting phase space for both beyond the Standard Model searches and precision measurements. I will present the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment’s most recent search for heavy stable charged particles (HSCPs) in the tracker using dE/dx information. Characterized by anomalously large ionization energy loss, HSCPs are a signature driven search enabled by the inclusion of low-level information in the readout of the silicon pixels and strips. Looking toward future colliders, the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) recommendation of a Higgs factory demands precision detectors. To meet this challenge, we are developing high resolution homogenous crystal calorimetry through the measurement and separation of scintillation and Cherenkov light -- information that currently is lost in calorimeters like those in CMS. This talk will review our first proof-of-principle measurements collecting Cherenkov and scintillation light in homogeneous crystals preparing for the precision electromagnetic calorimeter layers of the future.",

        "description": "Abstract: Quantum computing and sensing represent two distinct frontiers of quantum information science. Here, we harness quantum computing to solve a fundamental and practically important sensing problem: the detection of weak oscillating fields with unknown strength and frequency. We present a quantum computing enhanced sensing protocol, that we dub quantum search sensing, outperforming all existing approaches. Furthermore, we prove our approach is optimal by establishing the Grover-Heisenberg limit -- a fundamental lower bound on the minimum sensing time. The key idea is to robustly digitize the continuous, analog signal into a discrete operation, which is then integrated into a quantumalgorithm. Our metrological gain originates from quantum computation, distinguishing our protocol from conventional sensing approaches. Indeed, we prove that broad classes of protocols based on quantum Fisher information, finite-lifetime quantum memory, or classical signal processing are strictly less powerful. We propose and analyze a proof-of-principle experiment using nitrogen-vacancy centers, where meaningful improvements are achievable using current technology. This work establishes quantum computation as a powerful new resource for advancing sensing capabilities. Bio: Soonwon Choi is a Victor F. Weisskopf Career Development Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT, whose research is focused on quantum information science and technology and its applications for studying out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Choi completed his undergraduate study in physics at Caltech in 2012, got his PhD degree in physics from Harvard University in 2018.

There are still many untapped research topics in this area: high-temperature applications, fast neutron detection for fission and fusion systems, use as an alternative to silicon for low-energy X-ray detection, SiC avalanche photodiodes for UV light detection, nuclear batteries, and even emerging work in quantum sensing due to its spin defects and potential for lab-on-chip device integration. In this talk, I will present our work on developing SiC for alpha spectroscopy, demonstrating performance up to 500 °C, its application in nuclear batteries, and our initial efforts toward quantum sensors for reactor dose monitoring, as well as future directions for MeV neutron detection. This seminar is also given as an IEEE NPSS Distinguished Lecture. Bio:  Dr. L.

        "description": "Speaker: Francesco Anna Mele (SNS Pisa)Title: From tomography of bosonic systems to a new measure of non-Gaussianity: the symplectic rankAbstract: Quantum state tomography, aimed at deriving a classical description of an unknown state from measurement data, is a fundamental task in quantum physics. In parallel, non-Gaussianity serves as a crucial resource for quantum information processing in continuous-variable (CV) systems. In this talk, we investigate the fundamental limits of quantum state tomography for CV systems, revealing a deep connection between the efficiency in tomography and the degree of non-Gaussianity. Specifically:We first show that tomography of general non-Gaussian states is extremely inefficient;In contrast, we demonstrate that tomography of Gaussian states is efficient. To accomplish this, we introduce new tools of independent interest: tight bounds on the trace distance between CV states in terms of the norm distance between their first moments and covariance matrices.We then explore the intermediate regime, establishing that tomography becomes progressively harder as the level of non-Gaussianity increases.The latter result naturally leads to the concept of symplectic rank: a novel non-Gaussianity monotone that satisfies remarkable operational and resource-theoretic properties. Mathematically, the symplectic rank of a pure state is the number of symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix that are strictly larger than the ones of the vacuum. Importantly, the symplectic rank is non-increasing under post-selected Gaussian operations, leading to strictly stronger no-go theorems for Gaussian conversion than those previously known.The talk will be based on: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01431, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02368, https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14979v1, and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19319.About: Weekly seminar of the Quantum Working Group, covering topics in quantum information theory and operator algebras.

        "description": "Shake it like a Polaroid picture: Ultrasound Imaging with Shear Waves and Radiation ForceAbstract: Ultrasound imaging finds wide and ever-increasing clinical use due to its low cost, lack of toxicity, and advances in signal processing power. While grayscale ultrasound imaging remains the clinical workhorse, developments in the ability of ultrasound to quantify tissue properties are increasing diagnostic capability. This talk will describe some ultrasound imaging techniques based on two properties: the ability of ultrasound to measure tissue displacements much smaller than a wavelength, and the acoustic radiation force phenomenon, which allows for the remote manipulation of tissues. We have exploited these properties to image implanted devices, quantify linear and non-linear tissue modulus, and estimate viscoelastic properties. Preliminary work on the application of acoustic radiation force and the elastic reciprocity theorem to image ultrasound attenuation will be described.Biography: Stephen McAleavey is currently an Associate Professor and the Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Rochester. He received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from that institution in 2002. His research focuses on methods of ultrasound imaging and tissue characterization. His work is especially focused on the use of shear waves, acoustic radiation force, and mechanical deformations to enhance imaging and obtain quantitative estimates of tissue properties.",

In this talk, I’ll walk through how immersive environments have been used to study human experience—not only as platforms for message delivery, but as media with their own psychological effects. I’ll highlight how the field has evolved from examining message-based influences to exploring how immersion itself shapes cognition, emotion, and behavior. Drawing on recent research, I’ll discuss how VR enables controlled, yet ecologically rich simulations that help us observe human responses in ways that traditional media cannot.Mike Yao:Mike Yao is Professor and Director of the Institute of Communications Research at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign.

        "title": "Intercellular Communication:  Can It Be Mediated by Electromagnetics?",
        "description": "Abstract:A group of cells within an organ or a community of unicellular organisms cannot function without being able to communicate.  Their proper function or even their survival relies on their ability to interact with each other and the outside environment. The commonly accepted communication mechanism among biological cells is known as quorum sensing (QS),  a process of communication by which cells release chemical molecules (auto-inducers) to their surroundings that can propagate through the process of diffusion and be received by the adjacent cells. This communication scheme, however, is slow as it relies on the diffusion of molecules in the surrounding medium. Additionally, it is estimated that individual cells require relatively large amount of energy (~mJ/mL) for such processes. Alternatively if cells were equipped with radio transceivers, communication links could be established by electromagnetics waves. To examine such hypothesis we focused our research on certain bacteria biofilms and postulated a mechanism for the operation of such biological radios. The operating principle for the embedded radios within cellular structures and biofilms is proposed to be based on mechanical antennas. Certain bacterial cells within their biofilms are equipped with elastic helical fibers called amyloid fibrils with a built-in permanent electric dipoles. Through metabolic activities and release of accumulated stress the cells mechanical motions is transferred to oscillation motion of charged amyloid fibrils. Accelerated charges of these fibrils radiate electromagnetic waves at frequencies that depend on different vibrational modes of the fibrils which may include one or more of the followings: 1) cantilever beam mode, 2) longitudinal spring vibrational mode, and 3) transverse spring modes. A theoretical multiphysics model based on coupled system of electrical and mechanical structures is developed to explain the operation of EM-based communication. Using communication channel theory, it is shown that EM signaling can provide much higher data rate (5 to 7 orders of magnitude) and over much longer ranges compared to QS. Guided by the theoretical model, novel measurement instrumentations are developed to explore the presence of electromagnetic radiation from growing bacterial biofilms in a controlled environment. These sensitive measurement systems together with appropriate signal processing tools are capable of detecting extremely weak signals in the presence of noise. In particular a wideband near-zone radiative system is designed to operate in 1-50 GHz range in a discovery mode. Then a near-filed spiral antenna system and a regenerative RF sensing system are designed and fabricated for more accurate measurements. We, for the first time, were able to identify EM radiation from Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in the 3-4 GHz frequency range consistently and repeatedly. Experiments were carried out to determine long-term and short-term cycles of the emitted signals over the course of  70-day experiments. Experimental techniques and results will be presented in this talk.Bio:Kamal Sarabandi (S’87-M’90-SM’92-F’00-LF’21) is the Fawwaz T. Ulaby Distinguished University Professor of EECS and the Rufus S.

        "description": "Optoelectronics On and In Tissue for Cardiac ModulationAbstract:Achieving fully untethered cardiac modulation remains a central challenge for advancing therapies against arrhythmia and other rhythm disorders. This seminar will introduce two emerging classes of bio-integrated optoelectronic systems that enable visible-light-induced cardiac stimulation without rigid implants, wires, or genetic modification. The first on-tissue platform features a tissue-like, rubbery optoelectronic stimulator constructed entirely from intrinsically stretchable semiconductors. Its soft mechanical properties allow intimate lamination onto the dynamic epicardial surface, delivering localized, wireless photostimulation synchronized with cardiac motion. The second in-tissue platform advances a bioprinted, optoelectronically active cardiac construct, in which microscale solar cells are seamlessly embedded within engineered cardiac tissue. Upon illumination, these hybrid tissues autonomously generate electrical potentials that accelerate cardiac beating both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a cell-instructive and self-stimulating paradigm. Together, these platforms highlight a new vision for wireless, light-driven cardiac interfaces, and redefine how we interact with the heart. Biography:Dr. Cunjiang Yu is the Founder Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He also holds joint appointments in the Departments of Materials Science and Engineering, of Mechanical Science and Engineering, and of Bioengineering. He received his PhD from Arizona State University in Mechanical Engineering and performed postdoctoral training at UIUC Materials Science and Engineering Department. His research focuses on the fundamentals and applications of soft and bio electronics. His work has been recognized by a few awards, including multiple Young Investigator Awards from the ASME, Society of Engineering Science, American Vacuum Society and ONR, the CAREER Award from NSF, Trailblazer Award from NIH, MIT Technology Review Innovator under 35 China, etc. Part of the Illinois Computer Science Speakers Series. Food will be provided after the seminar.If accommodation is required, please email <communications@cs.illinois.edu>.

        "description": "Biomimetic Nanostructured Interfaces for Enhanced Integration and Healing in Medical ImplantsAbstract: Surfaces that contain micro- and nanoscale features in a well-controlled, “engineered” and biomimetic manner have been shown to significantly affect cellular and subcellular function of various biological systems.  Our research is focused towards using the tools of micro- and nanotechnology for applications in biomaterials and tissue engineering. The goal of current research is to design material surfaces that induce controlled, guided, and rapid healing in medical devices such as orthopedic implants, stents and heart valves.  In addition to acceleration of normal wound healing phenomena, these implants should result in the formation of a characteristic interfacial layer with adequate biomechanical properties.  To achieve these goals, however, a better understanding of events at the tissue-material interface is needed, as well as the development of new materials and approaches that promote biointegration.  Our work proposes the use of well-controlled biomimetic nanostructured interfaces to enhance implant integration. We hypothesize that controlled biomimetic nanoscale architectures can promote cell differentiation and matrix production and enhance short-term and long-term integration, while preventing undesired responses such as infection and inflammation.  Moreover, the ability to create model nano-dimensional constructs that mimics physiological systems can aid in studying complex tissue interactions in terms of cell communication, response to matrix geometry, and effect of external chemical stimuli. By understanding how physical surface parameters influence cells, we can more effectively design material surfaces that can be used in a clinical setting for medical devices. Biography: Dr. Popat is a Professor and Chair in the Department of Bioengineering at George Mason University.   Prior to coming to George Mason University, he was Professor in Department of Mechanical Engineering/School of Biomedical Engineering at Colorado State University for 16 years. His laboratory focuses on developing biomimetic surfaces with controlled biological functions towards development of orthopedic and cardiovascular medical devices. He has authored over 180 peer-reviewed publications in journals such as ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, Advanced Materials Interfaces, Materials Advances, etc. and has an h-index of 55.  He has presented his work at numerous national and international level conferences, has established strong research as well as educational collaborations with researchers from Brazil, India, South Africa, Italy, etc. He has also received several awards, namely, Office of International Programs Distinguished Service Award, Outstanding Mid-Career Award, Teaching Excellence Award, Outstanding International Contributions Award and Outstanding Early Career Award from Colorado State University.

Wearable technologies can meet this need, but several design, validation, and efficacy factors must be carefully considered. This talk will explore the role of wearable technologies in dysphagia rehabilitation, with a focus on our lab’s development of i-Phagia, a wearable surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback device designed to enhance swallowing management. The journey from initial concept and prototyping through validation, iterative testing, and our ongoing NIH-funded clinical trial will be shared. Lessons learned, successes, and challenges along the way will also be discussed, as well as recent efforts to integrate multimodal imaging and AI for telehealth applications. The goal is to demonstrate how these efforts can help bridge the lab-clinic gap, enrich evidence-based practice, and introduce pathways to academic entrepreneurship as an exciting avenue for research innovation.",

Via electrodeposition, we have grown thick and dense LiCoO2, NaCoO2, LiMn2O4, and other related LTMO cathodes which provide near-theoretical capacities, good rate performances and long cycle lives. Via control of the electrodeposition parameters, including the molten salt electrolyte chemistry, deterministic synthesis of textured thick (>10 µm) films of with iso-oriented crystalline domains having controlled size dispersity and interfaces is demonstrated. When cycled, the properly oriented electrodes exhibit good capacity retention and good rate performance, even at high loadings while electrodes with randomly oriented crystalline domains fail quickly. Since the electrodeposited cathodes are ~95% dense, binder-free and conductive-additive free, they provide a 1.25x to 1.5x increase in the electrode level volumetric energy density compared to conventional slurry cathodes. The controlled surface area and surface crystallographic presentation makes these electrodes particularly amenable to gas-phase surface treatments which enhance high voltage operation. Finally, we show that these nearly single crystal cathodes enable fabrication of solid-state batteries which operate under very low stack pressures at room temperature. Bio: Prof. Paul V.

        "description": "Speaker BioDr. Stephen Hammes’ research interests include steroidogenesis and steroid signaling, with a focus on extranuclear, or nongenomic, steroid effects. He studies these processes in the context of female reproduction, where his lab has demonstrated the importance of androgen signaling in normal ovarian function. In addition, the Hammes lab studies steroid hormone signaling in hormone-sensitive cancers such as prostate cancer and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).\"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM): The “Other” Hormone-Sensitive Cancer\"LAM is a rare cystic lung disease found almost exclusively in women. The cystic lung changes are caused by small multifocal smooth muscle cell clusters in the lungs that contain mutations in one of the two tuberous sclerosis (TSC) genes. In patients, LAM is highly estrogen sensitive, as it worsens with puberty, pregnancy, and oral contraception, and stabilizes after menopause. To explain the remarkable female predominance of LAM and its estrogen sensitivity, we proposed that LAM smooth muscle cells in the lungs may originate from the myometrium of the uterus. In fact, when we knocked out TSC2 expression in the uterus, all mice developed aggressive myometrial growth that resembled LAM, with 50% developing lung myometrial nodules from the uterus later in life. Mouse TSC2-null uteri were highly sensitive to estradiol, as growth was eliminated with oophorectomy or aromatase inhibitor treatment.In contrast, isolated LAM cells from these mouse uteri and other TSC2-null cells had minor estradiol sensitivity in vitro, suggesting that in vivo estradiol promotes LAM progression indirectly. Using various strategies, we have discovered that, in addition to directly stimulating LAM cells, estradiol enhances innate immune responses that promote LAM progression. We have also begun elucidating estradiol-related pathways that modulate innate immunity in the bone marrow and tumor bed.",

In the Urbana-Champaign community, we have woven these confluences through a multitude of interconnected threads, making it a way of life. In a project-based interdisciplinary course entitled Where the Arts meets Physics, we bring alive the universe, classical phenomena, and the quantum world through installations, performance, and more. Science, theater, music, dance, and circus have joined hands in several large-scale performance pieces such as Quantum Voyages, The Joy of Regathering, and Cosmic Whispers: Shared Voices. In turn, these endeavors have vastly enriched our physics research. We have come together as CASCaDe, Collective for Art-Science, Creativity and Discovery, etc. As one of our deeply cherished art-science anchors, the extraordinary Latrelle Bright, would say, “We are all storytellers”, a profound guiding perspective in our community’s visions and work. Here, I shall share not only the stories told within our creations, but also the stories of how they came to be and of the wonder and curiosity they bring as we explore our shared place in the Universe. This colloquium is dedicated to the loving memory of Latrelle Bright.",

        "description": "Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has become the cornerstone of modern foundation models, enabling them to learn powerful representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data. By designing auxiliary tasks on raw inputs, SSL removes the reliance on human-provided labels and underpins the pretraining–finetuning paradigm that has reshaped machine learning beyond the traditional empirical risk minimization framework. Despite its remarkable empirical success, its theoretical foundations remain relatively underexplored. This gap raises fundamental questions about when and why SSL works, and what governs its generalization and robustness. In this talk, I will introduce representative SSL methodologies widely used in foundation models, and then present a series of our recent works on the theoretical understanding of SSL, with a particular focus on contrastive learning, masked autoencoders and autoregressive learning.Speaker Bio.: Yisen Wang is an Assistant Professor at Peking University.

        "description": "Abstract: In the compiler literature, parsing algorithms for context-free grammars are presented using string rewriting systems or abstract machines such as nondeterministic pushdown automata, but the resulting descriptions can be baroque, and even a basic understanding of some parsing algorithms, such as Earley’s algorithm for general context-free grammars, can be elusive. In this talk, we argue that these problems can be addressed by using a graphical representation of context-free grammars called the Grammar Flow Graph (GFG), which enables parsing problems to be reframed as reachability problems in graphs. Among other advantages, this leads to a simple description Earley's algorithm for parsing general context-free grammars and Knuth's algorithm for parsing of LR(k) grammars. These results suggest that the GFG can be a new foundation for studying and teaching context-free grammars. This is joint work with Gianfranco Bilardi, University of Padova, Italy.Bio: Keshav Pingali is a professor in the CS department at the University of Texas at Austin, where he holds the W.A.\"Tex\" Moncrief Chair of Computing.  He received the B.Tech. degree from I.I.T.

        "description": "vanessa german is a leading citizen artist working in sculpture, performance, and communal ritual to cultivate spiritual models for transforming human experience. Establishing her own self-taught approach and distinctive artistic language, german’s influential practice employs mineral crystals, beads, glass, found objects, and other sourced material to create expressive figurative sculptures that resound through the physical and metaphysical worlds. Her unique sculptural vocabulary transmits healing energy, affirming the power of love as an infinite human technology. Channeling precolonial and African diasporic traditions, her figures allude to the Kongo nkisi nkondi, each charged by the protective and restorative spirits that complement their physical materials. Guided by her own creativity, imagination and curiosity, german follows her intuition about the capacity for objects to tell stories, creating sculptures that resonate deeply with those who encounter them. The artist’s practice is intertwined with her history of activism and community leadership. Crediting her mother, the fiber artist Sandra Keat German, with inspiring her sense of creative purpose, german realized her first power figures on the front porch of her home, where she would invite neighbors to join her. She would soon found the arts initiative Love Front Porch in 2011 before establishing ARThouse, combining a community studio and artist residency for her neighbors, in 2014. german has received numerous accolades over the course of her career, including the Joyce Foundation Fellowship (2024), Heinz Award for the Arts (2022), Don Tyson Prize from the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (2018), United States Artist Grant (2018), Jacob Lawrence Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2017) and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Grant (2015).",

        "description": "Recent advancements in ultrafast techniques including x-ray scattering and THz spectroscopy enable the detection of collective dynamics with unprecedented spatial, temporal, and energy resolution, shedding light on the fundamental dynamical processes in quantum materials. This talk will focus on our recent efforts to track emergent dynamical properties in polar nanostructures and at oxide surfaces. In the first example, the collective dynamics of polar vortices and skyrmions in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices were discovered by THz-field-driven ultrafast x-ray scattering [1,2], opening a new avenue for high-frequency ferroelectric and optoelectronic applications. In the second example, a surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz emission spectroscopy was developed to characterize distinct surface phonon dynamics of SrTiO3 and KTaO3 that diverge significantly from the bulk counterparts [3], which have important implications for the interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. Looking into the future, the recent progress of developing multimodal, multiscale dynamical imaging platforms at large-scale facilities will be discussed [4,5].References:[1] Q.

        "description": "Abstract: Robot safety is a nuanced concept. We commonly equate safety with collision-avoidance, but in complex, real-world environments (i.e., the \"\"open world'') it can be much more: for example, a mobile manipulator should understand when it is not confident about a requested task, that areas roped off by caution tape should never be breached, and that objects should be gently manipulated to prevent breaking or spilling. However, designing robots that have such a nuanced safety understanding---and can reliably generate appropriate actions---is an outstanding challenge.In this talk, I will describe my group's work on systematically uniting modern machine learning models (such as large vision-language models and latent world models) with classical formulations of safety in the control literature to generalize safe robot decision-making to increasingly open world interactions. Throughout the talk, I will present experimental instantiations of these ideas in domains like vision-based robotic manipulation and navigation.Bio: Andrea Bajcsy is an Assistant Professor in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where she leads the Interactive and Trustworthy Robotics Lab (Intent Lab).

        "title": "Machine Learning Seminar: Dylan Zhang, \"Supervision Shall Fit the Model During Supervised\n                              Fine-tuning.\"",
        "description": "Abstract: Instruction tuning has often been viewed through the lens of distilling “better” behavior from stronger teacher models. However, this framing can misalign with the actual inductive biases and capabilities of the target base model. In this talk, we revisit what truly matters for efficient and effective offline training. We introduce GRAPE, a model-aware data selection strategy designed to align supervision with the model itself. For each instruction, GRAPE selects the candidate response that the target model assigns the highest likelihood, and fine-tunes on that response—producing supervision that is distributionally well-matched to the model rather than imitative of an external teacher. Beyond GRAPE, we extend our discussion by situating this approach within a broader rethinking of supervision for SFT. We highlight two complementary directions in recent literature: (1) alternative post-training objectives that deviate from pure next-token likelihood to better fit models at different capability levels, and (2) token-level reweighting and controlled update schemes such as TALR, which preserve general competence while enabling targeted specialization. Together, these perspectives point toward a unifying view: effective instruction tuning is not about enforcing an abstract notion of “best answers,” but about curating both data and loss functions to fit the model we actually want to deploy.Bio: Dylan Zhang is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. Hao Peng. His research focuses on large language model (LLM) post-training, particularly on developing offline training algorithms for efficient and effective model alignment. More broadly, he is interested in understanding the behavior, generalization, and inductive biases of large language models—how they learn from data, adapt through supervision, and exhibit emergent capabilities.",

        "description": "Zoom: https://illinois.zoom.us/j/84367822181?pwd=BUZfCKruikpgbLUbsaqrndrN74a4w3.1Refreshments Provided.Abstract: We will discuss two recent developments in scientific processes.1) Autonomous AI Scientists: Research conducted by autonomous AI scientist systems is rapidly increasing in prevalence. These systems execute the entire research process autonomously, with little or no human intervention. Papers generated by such systems have been accepted at reputable venues, including the ACL conference and ICLR workshops. While papers generated by AI scientist systems appear appealing, we dig deeper into their workflow and investigate whether these systems follow rigorous research methodologies. Using novel experiments designed to mitigate confounding factors, we uncover significant and concerning methodological flaws in the workflow followed by autonomous AI scientists. We also propose a method to detect these problems and provide policy recommendations for journals and conferences: such methodological problems are not detectable from the produced paper alone but can be identified through analysis of the trace logs of the workflow executed by the AI scientists.2) Lotteries for Funding: Traditional funding decisions (such in the NSF) involve expert reviews followed by panel discussions to determine which proposals are funded. More recently though, citing drawbacks of the traditional approach, a number of funding agencies worldwide have moved towards a different decision model. These agencies have incorporated “partial lotteries” into their decision-making: the review process remains similar to that of the NSF (sometimes omitting panel discussions), but the final decisions introduce a randomized component that still respects reviewers’ evaluations. We will first identify several problems in current implementations of such partial lotteries. We will then present a principled approach to designing improved partial lotteries with strong theoretical guarantees and empirical performance.The talk will also contain a generous dose of minions. Bio:Nihar B. Shah is an Associate Professor in the Machine Learning and Computer Science departments at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). His research focuses on the Evaluation of Science and the Science of Evaluation.

Kannan and Lov\\'asz proved that $\\mu(\\Lambda,K) \\leq n \\cdot \\mu_{KL}(\\Lambda,K)$ and the Subspace Flatness Conjecture by Dadush (2012) claims a $O(\\log n)$ factor suffices, which would match the lower bound from the work of Kannan and Lov\\'asz. We settle this conjecture up to a constant in the exponent by proving that  $\\mu(\\Lambda,K) \\leq O(\\log^{3}(n)) \\cdot \\mu_{KL} (\\Lambda,K)$. Our proof is based on the Reverse Minkowski Theorem due to Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz (2017). Following the work of Dadush (2012, 2019), we obtain a $(\\log n)^{O(n)}$-time randomized algorithm tosolve integer programs in $n$ variables. Another implication of our main result is a near-optimal \\emph{flatness constant} of $O(n \\log^{3}(n))$.This is joint work with Victor Reis.Bio: Thomas Rothvoss is Professor of Mathematics & Computer Science at the University of Washingtonand works on questions in linear and integer programming, discrepancy theory and approximation algorithms.He completed his PhD in Mathematics in 2009 at EPFL under Friedrich Eisenbrand, followed by aPostDoc at MIT with Michel Goemans.

        "description": "Abstract: The surface code is one of the leading approaches to building a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A central challenge for the surface code is implementing non-Clifford operations -- unitaries which map Pauli operators to non-Pauli operators. In this talk, I will introduce group surface codes, which are a natural generalization of the usual Z_2 surface code and can be understood as quantum double models of finite groups with specific boundary conditions. I will show that group surface codes, for suitably chosen groups, can be leveraged to perform non-Clifford gates in the Z_2 surface code. Time permitting, I will describe three strategies for completing a universal gate set using group surface codes: through magic state preparation, using transversal non-Clifford gates, and by sliding group surfacecodes. These strategies extend recent efforts in performing universal quantum computation in topological orders without the braiding of anyons. Moreover, they show how certain group surface codes allow us to bypass the restrictions set by the Bravyi-König theorem, which limits the computational power of topological Pauli stabilizer models.This is based on work in progress with Naren Manjunath, Vieri Mattei, and Apoorv Tiwari.Zoom Link: https://illinois.zoom.us/my/icmt.seminar?pwd=ZU1KbnBLeXZLUmJKc0oyU205cDNDdz09Meeting ID: 791 382 8328Password: 106237",

I will describe three methods we have developed, in response to new problems arising from recently developed spatial genomics technologies, that leverage manifold learning, network embedding, sparse matrix decomposition, and causal representation learning. I will then highlight additional areas ripe for new ideas. Bio:Dave Zhao is an Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

        "description": "Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect, driven by strong correlations in Landau levels, has long stood as a paradigm of emergent topological order and fractionalized quasiparticles with potential applications in quantum computation. A long-standing goal has been to realize its zero-field counterpart, the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, which is predicted to arise in topological flat bands through interaction-induced breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Here we report the observation of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. At zero magnetic field, in addition to a C = 1 quantum anomalous Hall state, we observe eleven fractionally quantized Hall resistance plateaus Rxy=h/(νe2) at filling factors including ν=2/3, 3/5, 4/7… 4/9, 3/7, and 1/3. Near half-filling, the Hall resistance varies linearly with carrier density and approaches Rxy=2h/e2, reminiscent of the composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Landau level. Most notably, further experiments reveal the coexistence of FQAH states, electron crystallization, and superconductivity at lower electron temperatures. Together, these results establish rhombohedral graphene moiré superlattices as a versatile platform for realizing exotic correlated topological phases and for exploring quasiparticles with fractional statistics, ultimately advancing toward non-Abelian anyons, key building blocks for universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation.",

        "description": "Abstract: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge causes higher response delay. Prior work focuses either on reducing the response delay (e.g., better scheduling of RAG queries) or on maximizing quality (e.g., tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in systematically balancing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. To balance both quality and response delay, this paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods. Using four popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared to the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, METIS reduces the generation latency by 1.64 – 2.54× without sacrificing generation quality. Bio: Siddhant is a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, advised by Junchen Jiang and Nick Feamster. His research interests lie in efficient serving systems for Large Language Models, focusing on Compound-AI systems like RAG and also machine learning methods for performance improvement in systems and networks.",

        "description": "Abstract: LLVM's backends translate its intermediate representation to assembly or object code. In effect, these compiler backends are highly optimizing compilers in their own right, and they contain bugs. As a step towards gaining confidence in the correctness of work done by LLVM backends, we have created arm-tv and riscv-tv, which formally verify translations between LLVM IR and 64-bit ARM and RISC-V code. Ours is not the first translation validation work for LLVM, but we have advanced the state of the art along multiple fronts: we enforce various ABI rules; we have extended Alive2 (which we reuse as a verification backend) to deal with unstructured mixes of pointers and integers that are typical of assembly code; we investigate the tradeoffs between hand-written AArch64 semantics and those derived mechanically from ARM's published formal semantics; and, we have discovered 46 previously unknown miscompilation bugs in LLVM backends many of which affected multiple targets and most of which are now fixed in upstream LLVM.Bio: John Regehr has been on the computer science faculty at the University of Utah since 2003. All of his recent work is on making compilers less buggy, easier to engineer, and more highly optimizing. When not working, he tries to spend as much time as possible outdoors.",

His research initially focused on policy gradient algorithms, off-policy evaluation, confidence intervals, high-confidence safety guarantees for RL, and fairness; more recently, it has shifted toward the intersection of RL and the philosophy of mind.Part of the Siebel School Speakers Series.
