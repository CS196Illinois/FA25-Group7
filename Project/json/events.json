        "title": "The Temptations & The Four Tops",
        "description": "THE TEMPTATIONS: The Temptations, often referred to as American music royalty, are world-renowned superstars of entertainment, revered for their phenomenal catalog of music and prolific career. They are one of the most iconic, bestselling brands in the entertainment world today. While the group has evolved over the years, Dr. Otis Williams has continued to lead the group and carry the torch forward for the next generation of Temptations’ fans. The Temptations are headlining concerts around the country throughout 2025. Their concerts include fan favorites such as “My Girl,” “Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me),” “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg,” “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone,” and more.  Ranked #1 in Billboard magazine’s most recent list of the “Greatest R&B/Hip-Hop Artists of All Time,” The Temptations also appear in the magazine’s 125th Anniversary list of the “125 Greatest of All Time Artists.” In addition, Rolling Stone magazine named the group among the “100 Greatest Artists of All Time.” In September of 2020, the editors of Rolling Stone magazine commented that The Temptations are “Indisputably the greatest black vocal group of the Modern Era…,” and listed the group’s Anthology album among the “500 Greatest Albums of All Time.” The Anthology album has appeared in all three of Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums’ lists.   The Temptations have been the subject of a smash hit Broadway musical, Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of The Temptations, based on Otis Williams’ personal journey, which opened on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on March 21st, 2019. The musical received 12 Tony nominations, including Best Musical, and won the Tony Award® for Best Choreography at the 73rd Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 10, 2019. Now on tour, the Musical is scheduled to open in theaters in more than 50 cities across the U.S. during the next several years. Ain’t Too Proud opened in the UK, in the West End of London, at the Prince Edward Theatre on April 20, 2023. For details, see the link here: https://ainttooproudmusical.com/ The Temptations’ heritage, influence, and contributions to, not only American culture and African American communities but also to the global music landscape are monumental. The Temptations’ presence in the world today has never been more vivid, and their popularity is ever-increasing.    THE FOUR TOPS The quartet, originally called the Four Aims, made their first single for Chess in 1956, and spent seven years on the road and in nightclubs, singing pop, blues, Broadway, but mostly jazz—four-part harmony jazz. When Motown’s Berry Gordy Jr. found out they had hustled a national “Tonight Show” appearance, he signed them without an audition to be the marquee act for the company’s Workshop Jazz label. That proved short-lived, and Stubbs’ powerhouse baritone lead and the exquisite harmonies of Fakir, Benson, and Payton started making one smash after another with the writing-producing trio Holland-Dozier-Holland.   Their first Motown hit, “Baby I Need Your Loving” in 1964, made them stars and their sixties track record on the label is indispensable to any retrospective of the decade. Their songs, soulful and bittersweet, were across-the-board successes. “I Can’t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch),” a no. 1 R&B and Pop smash in 1965, is one of Motown’s longest-running chart toppers; it was quickly followed by a longtime favorite, “It’s The Same Old Song” (no. 2 R&B/no. 5 pop). Their commercial peak was highlighted by a romantic trilogy: the no. 1 “Reach Out I’ll Be There,” “Standing In The Shadows Of Love” (no. 2 R&B/no. 6 pop) and “Bernadette” (no. 3 R&B/no. 4 pop)—an extraordinary run of instant H-D-H classics. Other Tops hits from the decade included “Ask The Lonely,” “Shake Me, Wake Me (When It’s Over),” “Something About You,” “You Keep Running Away,” “7-Rooms Of Gloom” and their covers of “Walk Away Renee” and “If I Were A Carpenter.” The group was also extraordinarily popular in the U.K.   After H-D-H split from Motown, producer Frank Wilson supervised the R&B Top 10 hits “It’s All In The Game” and “Still Water (Love)” at the start of the seventies. The Tops also teamed with Motown’s top girl group, the Supremes, post-Diana Ross. Billing themselves The Magnificent Seven for a series of albums, they hit with a cover of “River Deep - Mountain High.”   When Motown left Detroit in 1972 to move to Los Angeles, the steadfast Tops decided to stay at home, and with another label. They kept up a string of hits with ABC-Dunhill for the next few years: “Ain’t No Woman (Like The One I’ve Got),” a Top 5 hit; the Top 10 “Keeper Of The Castle”; and the R&B Top 10’s “Are You Man Enough (from the movie Shaft In Africa),” “Sweet Understanding Love,” “One Chain Don’t Make No Prison” (later covered by Santana), “Midnight Flower” and the disco perennial “Catfish.”   In 1980 the group moved to Casablanca Records. The following year they were at no. 1 again, with “When She Was My Girl,” making them one of the few groups to have hits in three consecutive decades. They also scored R&B Top 40s with the ballads “Tonight I’m Gonna Love You All Over” and “I Believe In You And Me,” the original version of the 1996 Whitney Houston smash. And the Tops were heard in the film Grease 2 with “Back To School Again.” By 1983, riding the wave of the company’s 25th anniversary celebration, the Tops were back with Motown and H-D-H. The reunion resulted in the R&B Top 40 hits “I Just Can’t Walk Away” and “Sexy Ways.”   They signed with Arista later in the decade, and there they racked up their final solo Top 40 hit, “Indestructible,” which was the theme of the 1988 Summer Olympics. That year they also partnered with Aretha Franklin, a longtime friend from Detroit, for the Top 40 R&B “If Ever A Love There Was.” During this period, Stubbs stepped out and gained notoriety for voicing the man-eating plant Audrey II in the film musical Little Shop Of Horrors, for which he sang the cult classic “Mean Green Mother From Outer Space.”   In 1990, with 24 Top 40 pop hits to their credit, the Four Tops were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame. Though they would no longer have hits on record, the group continued to be a hit in concert, touring incessantly, a towering testament to the enduring legacy of the Motown Sound they helped shape and define. Following Payton’s death in 1997, the group briefly worked as a trio until Theo Peoples, a former Temptation, was recruited to restore the group to a quartet. When Stubbs subsequently grew ill, Peoples became the lead singer and former Motown artist-producer Ronnie McNeir was enlisted to fill Payton’s spot. In 2005, when Benson died, Payton’s son Roquel replaced him.   For Rolling Stone’s 2004 article “The Immortals – The Greatest Artists Of All Time,” Smokey Robinson remembered: “They were the best in my neighborhood in Detroit when I was growing up (and) the Four Tops will always be one of the biggest and the best groups ever. Their music is forever.\"",

Ranging from ancient Greece to seventeenth century France to twentieth century Britain, this exhibit will explore Sappho as poet, muse, and icon.The exhibit, Sweetbitter: The Literary Legacies and Afterlives of Sappho, will be on display in the RBML through May 2025.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "description": "Join us for a lecture in the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age Speaker Series with John Durham Peters.Considering Forgiveness in a Time of Ubiquitous RecordingThe shift of the basis of public life from slow and centralized print and audiovisual media to faster, ubiquitous, distributed, user-generated short-form word and video material has been widely noted.  I want to ask what the new mode of incessant documentation of raw behavior means for the possibility of both forgiveness and the collective learning process essential to public deliberation.  If every word or deed is frozen in its first draft, what then?  Some consequences are the once ubiquitous genre of the “statement” as apparently trustworthy speech, the recoding of common knowledge as corrosive secrets whose exposure is worried to have damaging effects, and an obsessive public hermeneutics of small nonverbal gestures at the expense of speech.  Is a reformist or redemptive rethink of this communication infrastructure possible or are we stuck?  What are the morally distorting effects of omnipresent surveillance?  This talk might not answer that question, but it will tease it in many ways.    About the SpeakerJohn Durham Peters is the María Rosa Menocal Professor of English and Professor of Film and Media Studies at Yale University. He teaches and writes on media history and theory. He taught at the University of Iowa between 1986-2016. He is the author of Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication (1999), Courting the Abyss: Free Speech and the Liberal Tradition (2005), The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of Elemental Media (2015), and most recently, Promiscuous Knowledge: Information, Image, and Other Truth Games in History (2020), with the late Kenneth Cmiel. He is working on a media history of weather. About the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital AgeHoused in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age supports study and research into the possibilities for human flourishing in contemporary society.The activities of the Forum combine philosophical reflection on human nature and the human good with practical reflection on the possibilities for living well, and for designing tools that contribute to human flourishing, in a world shaped by digital technology.

        "description": "The ancient poet Sappho coined “sweetbitter” in one of her most evocative verses, still striking us to the heart nearly three millennia later. But who was Sappho? As with so many ancient figures, she is more legend than person today, her story told and retold even as her poetry continues to enchant and move us. Ranging from ancient Greece to seventeenth century France to twentieth century Britain, this exhibit will explore Sappho as poet, muse, and icon.The exhibit, Sweetbitter: The Literary Legacies and Afterlives of Sappho, will be on display in the RBML through May 2025.",

        "description": "In the face of organized attacks on trans health care, trans advocates frequently emphasize empirical research showing vanishingly low rates of regret about transition. This talk considers how the public denial of regret and other \"bad feelings\"—though used to defend trans people—is ineffective in an authoritarian political context. I show how this strategy can demand an unwavering sense of happiness, enlisting trans people to police our own emotions and greatly limiting the affective scope of trans life. I draw from reproductive and disability justice as models that intentionally hold space for regret, grief, and ambivalence, even under significant political pressure to reject them. At its heart, this talk argues that embracing such feelings, rather than denying them, can better counter authoritarian efforts to constrain and diminish trans life.",

        "description": "This symposium will explore artistic production, practices, and the agency of printed media before 1750 as they intersect with themes of sexuality and gender.Conceptions of sexuality and gender underwent profound changes in Europe during the premodern era (roughly 1300–1750) and were an important avenue of exploration for printmakers. In art prints, broadsheets, fashion plates, and anatomies alike, human subjects were fashioned and viewed in conversation with cultural attitudes and beliefs about gender and sexuality. Canonical works such as Albrecht Dürer’s \"Adam and Eve\" and Henrick Goltzius’s \"Farnese Hercules as Seen from Behind\" not only convey notions of artistic excellence but also their ideas about idealized bodies, gender roles, and sexuality. Additionally, gender and sexuality had profound effects on artistic practices and training. In a time when many women were precluded from traditional apprenticeships and professional guilds, printmaking could present alternative paths to collaboration and network building. Moreover, as an artform linked with the broad circulation of knowledge but also with intimate, private viewing, prints open doors to consider how artists and beholders conceived of their own experiences of gender and sexuality in and outside of social norms.This symposium focused on sexuality and gender is being held in conjunction with Imagination, Faith, and Desire: Art and Agency in European Prints, 1475–1800, curated by Maureen Warren, Curator of European and American Art, and on view at Krannert Art Museum from Sep 25, 2025–Feb 28, 2026.The event will be hybrid, blending in-person presentations with online presentations via Zoom to make the event more equitable and permit international participation and will also include a walk-through of the exhibition.The keynote speaker will be Dr. Nicole Cook, Senior Program Manager at the Center for Netherlandish Art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Dr. Cook will share her research about seventeenth-century Dutch prints of “nightwalkers” and how they envisage a space for gender nonconformity.Speakers include:• Saskia Beranek, Ph.D., Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts, Illinois State University• Sunmin Cha, Ph.D. Candidate, Columbia University, New York• Kendra Grimmett, Ph.D., Ball State University• Darja (Daria) Kocerova, Ph.D. Candidate, The Warburg Institution, London• Tatiana C.

This workshop covers the what-why-& how of scoping reviews, including research question framework, search strategies and screening results. Finally, key differences between scoping reviews and systematic reviews will be described.Related LibGuide: Evidence Synthesis Service by Evidence SynthesisTHIS SESSION WILL BE TAUGHT ON ZOOM (YOUR REGISTRATION + REMINDER EMAILS WILL INCLUDE THE LINK).In order to attend online workshops, you will need a NetID assigned to you from the University of Illinois and you will need to be logged into your Illinois Zoom account. -----NOTE: Registration closes two hours before each scheduled workshop you will receive a registration + reminder email one hour before the session is scheduled to start.

As it turns out, it's pretty simple: human relationships. Decades of research demonstrate the transformative potential and the lasting legacies of a relationship-rich college experience. Critics suggest that to build connections with peers, faculty, staff, and other mentors is expensive and only an option at elite institutions where instructors have the luxury of time with students. But in this revelatory book brimming with the voices of students, faculty, and staff from across the country, Peter Felten and Leo M. Lambert argue that relationship-rich environments can and should exist for all students at all types of institutions.",

Arts and crafts include disciplines such as ceramics, textiles, woodworking, lacquerware, papermaking, and other means of artistic expression that involve considerable understanding of traditional methods and techniques. Artisans hone their skills to create objects that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Kogei artists and their produced objects are valued for their rich history that reflect intangible cultural heritage spanning hundreds of years, as techniques and processes are passed down from generation to generation. A category of kogei is mingei, (民芸), which translates to “folk crafts,” and is formed from minshu (民衆), meaning common people, and kogei (工芸). Art critic and philosopher Soetsu Yanagi created this term and the mingei movement in the 1920/30s to distinguish the value of everyday items made for ordinary use for the common person.The Kogei exhibition and programming are supported by the Japan Foundation New York through the U.S.-Japan Community Grassroots Exchange Program. Japan House is proud to highlight the traditional arts and crafts of Fukushima and feature the stories of Fukushima. Japan House acknowledges support from the Illinois Arts Council for this program.

        "description": "Japan House is pleased to host a Japanese calligraphy (shodo) workshop featuring Fukushima artist Seiran Chiba as part of the Kogei: Traditional Arts and Crafts project. Guests will learn about the basics of Japanese calligraphy and practice writing with her guidance before creating their own masterpiece.Shodo is the “the way of writing,” and it is also referred to as shuji, or calligraphy. Writing becomes elevated as an art form and means of expression through the study and practice of penmanship. Thus, the spirit of the brush becomes alive and reflects the kokoro (heart, mind, and spirit) of the artist. The Japanese writing system utilizes kanji, or Chinese characters, and a single ideogram can convey a concept or idea. Calligraphy can be used on materials beyond paper or canvas such as on ceramics. Looking closely, each stroke is deliberately executed to create an evocative and emotional message with just a few characters.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop. Guests will be provided with supplies but are asked to wear dark clothing that they don't mind getting ink on.________Seiran Chiba is a world-renowned Japanese shodo (calligraphy) artist from Fukushima, Japan. Born in Tokyo, she now resides in Fukushima, and she is a Cultural Ambassador for the Fukushima Tourism Exchange. She is active as a traveling calligrapher, embarking on journeys such as the ‘Calligraphy Tour of All 59 Municipalities in Fukushima Prefecture’ and the ‘Japanese Calligraphy Journey.’ Since 2013, she has been conducting large-scale calligraphy demonstrations and workshops at overseas educational institutions. In 2020, she provided calligraphy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic commemorative monument, and in 2024, she won the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award at the 2024 National Open Calligraphy Exhibition.Chiba has a modern approach to large-scale calligraphy inspired by hope and peace through her performances. In Japan, she taught calligraphy to adults and children living in temporary housing that remained after the 2011 tsunami. Through calligraphy, she teaches the importance of expressing one’s feelings and travels all over Japan with her calligraphy brush to share the beauty and strength of the Fukushima people despite the continued hardships that they still incur. Chiba visited Japan House in 2013 and 2018 for demonstrations and workshops with the local, university, and K-12 communities. She was a featured artist for Japan House’s Matsuri in 2018. In 2023, Japan House received the Education Grant from the Japan Foundation New York to support Chiba for an artist residency to teach calligraphy in Urbana-Champaign and perform at Matsuri. Chiba returned in 2024 to host workshops in Urbana-Champaign and was the featured artist for Gardens for Peace at Japan House. She continues to make visits to the United States to share her story and that of Fukushima through performances and workshops at numerous organizations.________Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts.

Guests will learn about the aizome craft process and history, then they can learn to stencil dye a Japanese paper fan to take home!Aizome is a traditional dyeing technique that uses indigo plants to color fabrics a deep blue (indigo) hue. In Fukushima Prefecture, indigo production thrived in areas such as Aizubange Town and Minamiaizu Town, reaching its peak during the Meiji era (around 1900). Even today, traditional indigo dyeing techniques are preserved in Minamiaizu and other parts of the region. One notable example of Aizome’s cultural significance is its connection to local festivals. The Tajima Gion Festival, held in Minamiaizu, features traditional men's attire (asa-kamishimo, hemp ceremonial robes) dyed using locally produced indigo by skilled artisans. This highlights the deep ties between indigo dyeing and regional traditions. Additionally, stencil dyeing techniques using katagami (dye paper stencils) were widely practiced, allowing artisans to create intricate fabric patterns. In the Aizu region of Fukushima Prefecture, a unique style of stencil known as Aizugata was developed and produced from the Edo period to the early Showa era. Today, Aizugata remains a cherished design, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern aesthetics.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop.

Dr. Craft holds a Master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from DePaul University in Chicago, and a PhD in Computer Science from University College London, where he studied at the UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC), an HCI research center. Craft was a co-founder of Tinker London, a design consultancy focused on creating products that bridge the digital and the physical. As a partner at Tinker London, Craft designed products and experiences for several high-profile clients including Sony, Nokia, and the BBC.Abstract:What does it mean to engineer with—not just for—people? In this talk, Brock introduces Human-Centered Engineering (HCE) as a response to a growing recognition: that many technical systems, however sophisticated, fall short when they overlook the messy, contextual, and deeply human dimensions of the world they aim to improve. Brock will explore how re-centering people in engineering practice raises new questions about purpose, process, and impact—questions that reach beyond any one engineering discipline. Through stories, reflection, and conversation, Brock will share what HCE looks like in practice, why it matters, and how educators, researchers, and institutions might support its growth. This talk invites those already doing this work to see themselves in a larger community, and those new to it to imagine new possibilities for engineering grounded in care, ethics, and shared understanding.",

        "description": "Join us for a free screening of the film \"Black Box Diaries\" followed by an in person Q&A with the filmmaker Shiori Itô,  The Q&A will be moderated by Belinda Qian He (EALC/Cinema Studies faculty) and Yuhan Zhang (EALC PhD student).  This is our first AsiaLENS film of the school year, we hope to see you there.About the Film:Black Box Diaries traces Itō’s courageous investigation of her own sexual assault, an improbable attempt to prosecute a high-profile offender that became a landmark case in Japan. Structured with the urgency of a thriller, the film weaves together audio recordings, vérité observation, first-person video clips, and an assembled case file—an “archive of her own”—to reveal the black boxes and blind spots in Japan’s judicial and social systems. Her practice bridges investigative reporting with the craft of cinema—mobilizing archival research, counter-forensic methods, and sustained fieldwork to turn personal evidence-gathering into pressingly needed public testimony. Premiering at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival and now released worldwide, the film has been nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA, received a Peabody Award, and garnered more than twenty international prizes, with screenings in over fifty countries.The film run time is 102 minutes.About the Filmmaker:Shiori Itō is an Oscar and BAFTA nominated documentary filmmaker, journalist, writer, and co-founder of Hanashi Films, focusing on gender-based human rights issues. Named one of TIME magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2020, her voice continues to resonate globally through film, writing, and public speaking.

        "description": "Professor Gino Pauselli (Political Science, UIUC), \"Critical Ties: How Reliable Information Suppliers Influence International Organizations' Propensity to Criticize States\"  October 21st at 12 pmCoble Hall 306 and ZoomDescription: This talk explores the role of reliable information suppliers in shaping the decisions of international organizations (IOs) to publicly criticize states' actions. Focusing on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), Dr. Pauselli examines how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with established ties to the Commission provide crucial information that influences IACHR's critical pronouncements. He proposes that IOs are more likely to issue public criticisms when they have access to information from NGOs that are not only knowledgeable but also deemed reliable through repeated interactions. Using an original dataset of press releases issued by the IACHR from 1996 to 2020, this study demonstrates that countries with a higher number of local NGOs participating in IACHR hearings are more likely to be subject to critical press releases. Furthermore, NGOs' expertise in particular human rights domains significantly correlates with targeted criticisms on those issues. These results highlight the importance of NGO-IO ties in the flow of reliable information and show the key role of trusted information suppliers in the international advocacy landscape. This study contributes to the understanding of how IOs navigate information asymmetries and emphasizes the strategic importance of reliable information in promoting states' accountability. Bio: Gino Pauselli is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at UIUC, specializing in the intersection of human rights, global governance, and transnational advocacy. Previously, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University.",

        "description": "Supermassive black hole binaries are thought to be an inevitable product of the prevailing galaxy evolution scenarios where most massive galaxies host a central black hole and undergo mergers over cosmic time. The early stages of this process have been observed in the form of interacting galaxy pairs and widely separated dual quasars, but the close, gravitationally bound binaries that are expected to follow have proven elusive. The detection of this population is important because at the smallest separations they become bright sources of low-frequency gravitational waves and are prime targets for multi-messenger detections with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this talk, I will discuss observational signatures of close binary supermassive black holes, especially in the context of regular quasar variability, and ongoing work towards multi-messenger detections with telescopes and gravitational wave detectors.",

Curaçao strategically used gifts, especially ritual objects, to shape and guide Jewish ritual and practice throughout the Atlantic World during the early modern period. Through this unidirectional flow of religious materials and personnel, the Mikve Israel congregation of Curaçao not only spread its customs and rituals but also cemented its status as the mother congregation of Jewish communities across colonial America.",

The Freedom of Fierro is the second part of the documentary The Years of Fierro, directed by Santiago Esteinou in 2014.You may remember that we welcomed Santiago and Cesar back in 2022 to discuss the first documentary about Cesar's case, The Years of Fierro.

        "title": "ISTC Webinar | Power Flows: Transmission and Generator Incentives",
        "description": "Abstract: The US electrical grid is experiencing a rapid transition as cheap renewable electricity transforms the energy mix. With these grid changes, new supply is not spatially matched to demand, and the transmission network has become more strained. Better market integration could thus lower US generation costs. This talk will present results from two projects, estimating (1) the excess generation costs associated with transmission congestion and other spatial constraints; and (2) how generator profitability would change if spatial constraints were eliminated. We document that eliminating interregional constraints could reduce generation costs by billions of dollars each year, but would create winners and losers among generation companies. The latter are especially of interest because generators have a large say in whether transmission projects are developed. Biography: Dr. Catie Hausman is an Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Her work focuses on environmental and energy economics. Recent projects have looked at electricity transmission policy; the natural gas sector's role in methane leaks; the economic damages from climate change; and inequality in pollution exposure. Prior to her graduate studies, Dr. Hausman studied in Peru under a Fulbright grant. She has taught Statistics, a policy seminar on Energy and the Environment, and a course on Government Regulation of Industry and the Environment. She holds a BA from the University of Minnesota and a PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of California, Berkeley.",

If you already have a team be sure to have the team lead complete the form and include the name and contact information for the full team. Deadline for registration is October 10, 2025.Eligibility: Teams must have two or more students (undergraduate and/or graduate) with at least one currently enrolled in the Computer Science Department. Students are encouraged to form teams of up to five students.Criteria: Teams will be evaluated on the following:Innovative approach with respect to utilizing LLMs to solve computationally challenging problems, generate and execute a workflow, as well as the use of machine learning, information visualization, and other computational techniques.Effective use of NCSA computing resources, including performance on its flagship AI platform.Quality of a written project summary and oral presentation.Relevance of the developed solution.Prize: 1st place $3000, 2nd place $1500, 3rd place $750HACKATHON PROJECTVirtual CRISPR: Can LLMs Predict CRISPR Screen Results?Problem: CRISPR-Cas systems enable systematic investigation of gene function, but experimental CRISPR screens are resource-intensive. Here, we would like to investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict the outcomes of CRISPR screens in silico, thereby prioritizing experiments and accelerating biological discovery. Our previous work (https://aclanthology.org/2025.bionlp-1.30/) produced a benchmark dataset (https://github.com/czbiohub-chi/immune-llm-acl) derived from BioGRID-ORCS and manually curated sources. We also evaluated the performance of several LLMs across various prompting strategies, including chain-of-thought and few-shot learning. Furthermore, we proposed a novel, efficient prediction framework using LLM-derived embeddings, achieving significantly improved performance and scalability compared to direct prompting. The goal of this hackathon competition is to push this work further to improve the performance of the prior work.",

        "description": "Japan House is pleased to host an aizome (indigo dyeing) workshop featuring Fukushima artist Hirohisa Saito as part of the Kogei: Traditional Arts and Crafts project. Guests will learn about the aizome craft process and history, then they can learn to stencil dye a Japanese paper fan to take home!Aizome is a traditional dyeing technique that uses indigo plants to color fabrics a deep blue (indigo) hue. In Fukushima Prefecture, indigo production thrived in areas such as Aizubange Town and Minamiaizu Town, reaching its peak during the Meiji era (around 1900). Even today, traditional indigo dyeing techniques are preserved in Minamiaizu and other parts of the region. One notable example of Aizome’s cultural significance is its connection to local festivals. The Tajima Gion Festival, held in Minamiaizu, features traditional men's attire (asa-kamishimo, hemp ceremonial robes) dyed using locally produced indigo by skilled artisans. This highlights the deep ties between indigo dyeing and regional traditions. Additionally, stencil dyeing techniques using katagami (dye paper stencils) were widely practiced, allowing artisans to create intricate fabric patterns. In the Aizu region of Fukushima Prefecture, a unique style of stencil known as Aizugata was developed and produced from the Edo period to the early Showa era. Today, Aizugata remains a cherished design, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern aesthetics.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop. Guests will be provided with all supplies but are asked to wear clothing that they don't mind getting ink on.________Hirohisa Saito is a printmaker and aizome (Japanese indigo dyeing) artist with nearly 40 years of experience in the field. He graduated from Nihon University College of Art in 1981 and completed additional studies at Nihon University College of Art's Art Research Institute in 1983. In 1985, he established Saito Graphic Arts. Saito spent two years in Los Angeles from 1989 as an Overseas Research Fellow for the Agency for Cultural Affairs to study screen printing. His works have been featured in solo exhibitions at various galleries and received various awards. As an educator, he is a part-time lecturer at Koriyama Women's University and a part-time lecturer at Tokyo University of the Arts. He is a Member of the Saitama Prefecture Art Association, Vice President of the Saitama Prefecture Printmakers’ Association, and Auditor of the Fukushima Watercolor Painting Association.________Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts. Arts and crafts include disciplines such as ceramics, textiles, woodworking, lacquerware, papermaking, and other means of artistic expression that involve considerable understanding of traditional methods and techniques. Artisans hone their skills to create objects that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Kogei artists and their produced objects are valued for their rich history that reflect intangible cultural heritage spanning hundreds of years, as techniques and processes are passed down from generation to generation. A category of kogei is mingei, (民芸), which translates to “folk crafts,” and is formed from minshu (民衆), meaning common people, and kogei (工芸). Art critic and philosopher Soetsu Yanagi created this term and the mingei movement in the 1920/30s to distinguish the value of everyday items made for ordinary use for the common person.The Kogei exhibition and programming are supported by the Japan Foundation New York through the U.S.-Japan Community Grassroots Exchange Program. Japan House is proud to highlight the traditional arts and crafts of Fukushima and feature the stories of Fukushima. This program is also partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council through federal funds provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.",

        "description": "Japan House is pleased to host a Japanese calligraphy (shodo) workshop featuring Fukushima artist Seiran Chiba as part of the Kogei: Traditional Arts and Crafts project. Guests will learn about the basics of Japanese calligraphy and practice writing with her guidance before creating their own masterpiece.Shodo is the “the way of writing,” and it is also referred to as shuji, or calligraphy. Writing becomes elevated as an art form and means of expression through the study and practice of penmanship. Thus, the spirit of the brush becomes alive and reflects the kokoro (heart, mind, and spirit) of the artist. The Japanese writing system utilizes kanji, or Chinese characters, and a single ideogram can convey a concept or idea. Calligraphy can be used on materials beyond paper or canvas such as on ceramics. Looking closely, each stroke is deliberately executed to create an evocative and emotional message with just a few characters.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop. Guests will be provided with supplies but are asked to wear dark clothing that they don't mind getting ink on.________Seiran Chiba is a world-renowned Japanese shodo (calligraphy) artist from Fukushima, Japan. Born in Tokyo, she now resides in Fukushima, and she is a Cultural Ambassador for the Fukushima Tourism Exchange. She is active as a traveling calligrapher, embarking on journeys such as the ‘Calligraphy Tour of All 59 Municipalities in Fukushima Prefecture’ and the ‘Japanese Calligraphy Journey.’ Since 2013, she has been conducting large-scale calligraphy demonstrations and workshops at overseas educational institutions. In 2020, she provided calligraphy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic commemorative monument, and in 2024, she won the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award at the 2024 National Open Calligraphy Exhibition.Chiba has a modern approach to large-scale calligraphy inspired by hope and peace through her performances. In Japan, she taught calligraphy to adults and children living in temporary housing that remained after the 2011 tsunami. Through calligraphy, she teaches the importance of expressing one’s feelings and travels all over Japan with her calligraphy brush to share the beauty and strength of the Fukushima people despite the continued hardships that they still incur. Chiba visited Japan House in 2013 and 2018 for demonstrations and workshops with the local, university, and K-12 communities. She was a featured artist for Japan House’s Matsuri in 2018. In 2023, Japan House received the Education Grant from the Japan Foundation New York to support Chiba for an artist residency to teach calligraphy in Urbana-Champaign and perform at Matsuri. Chiba returned in 2024 to host workshops in Urbana-Champaign and was the featured artist for Gardens for Peace at Japan House. She continues to make visits to the United States to share her story and that of Fukushima through performances and workshops at numerous organizations.________Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts.

If you already have a team be sure to have the team lead complete the form and include the name and contact information for the full team. Deadline for registration is October 10, 2025.Eligibility: Teams must have two or more students (undergraduate and/or graduate) with at least one currently enrolled in the Computer Science Department. Students are encouraged to form teams of up to five students.Criteria: Teams will be evaluated on the following:Innovative approach with respect to utilizing LLMs to solve computationally challenging problems, generate and execute a workflow, as well as the use of machine learning, information visualization, and other computational techniques.Effective use of NCSA computing resources, including performance on its flagship AI platform.Quality of a written project summary and oral presentation.Relevance of the developed solution.Prize: 1st place $3000, 2nd place $1500, 3rd place $750HACKATHON PROJECTVirtual CRISPR: Can LLMs Predict CRISPR Screen Results?Problem: CRISPR-Cas systems enable systematic investigation of gene function, but experimental CRISPR screens are resource-intensive. Here, we would like to investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict the outcomes of CRISPR screens in silico, thereby prioritizing experiments and accelerating biological discovery. Our previous work (https://aclanthology.org/2025.bionlp-1.30/) produced a benchmark dataset (https://github.com/czbiohub-chi/immune-llm-acl) derived from BioGRID-ORCS and manually curated sources. We also evaluated the performance of several LLMs across various prompting strategies, including chain-of-thought and few-shot learning. Furthermore, we proposed a novel, efficient prediction framework using LLM-derived embeddings, achieving significantly improved performance and scalability compared to direct prompting. The goal of this hackathon competition is to push this work further to improve the performance of the prior work.",

        "description": "The war diary, the most prominent genre at the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, reconfigures typical genre features, such as the focus on the self and the dynamic between the speaker and the addressee. It retains the dedication to contemporaneity and the chronological linearity of the narrative, which is presented as artless, private, and authentic, but prioritizes authenticity over other expectations. I examine the ways diarists position themselves as voices of the national collective, rely on the assumption of truthfulness, and construct the temporality of crisis and trauma.  This study contributes to the development of a theoretical framework for analyzing writings that emerge from crisis and impact our understanding of the workings of genres, trauma, and narrative in the digital age.Lyudmila Parts is Professor of Russian in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at McGill University (Montreal).

        "title": "Unlocking and accelerating physical activity opportunities for vulnerable children\n                              in Brazil: A path towards the sustainable school-based physical activity policy.",
        "description": "Given the direct and indirect effects of physical activity on multiple domains of life, promoting regular opportunities for movement from an early age is considered a vital investment for sustainable societies. However, countries in the Global South, such as Brazil, often face limited capacity and resources to respond to the global call for promoting physical activity. Vulnerable children in Brazil are accumulating less physical activity than the recommended amount during school hours. This Lemann Lecture Series presents results from a call to action focused on unlocking and accelerating physical activity opportunities for low-income children in Arapiraca, Alagoas, Brazil. The project comprised three interconnected studies. The first study, using a cross-sectional design, mapped organizational, political, and cultural factors within four schools and assessed physical activity levels among children (n = 250) during school hours. The second study aimed to develop a school-based physical activity policy through a mixed-methods co-creation process. A two-round Delphi methodology, consisting of an online survey and semi-structured interviews with principals, teachers, administrative staff, and superintendents, was employed to refine the policy and identify perceived barriers and facilitators for its adoption and implementation. The third study was a natural experiment with follow-up measures to evaluate the impact of partial policy adoption in two schools. Results revealed a significant association between school organization and built environment factors, explaining approximately 22% of the variance in children’s physical activity levels. The school-based policy integrates evidence-based guidance with local, context-specific insights to enhance feasibility and relevance. On average, at least 80% of policy items were rated highly in terms of importance, adoption, and implementation by stakeholders. Schools that adopted specific policy components—such as playground renovation and inclusion of a certified Physical Education teacher—showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in children’s physical activity. Future directions include scaling the policy to additional schools, evaluating its long-term impact on children’s physical activity patterns, and strengthening intersectoral collaboration across education, health, and urban planning sectors to ensure sustainable implementation. Rafael Tassitano is an Assistant Professor with 15 years of experience in physical activity epidemiology, focusing on underserved youth populations in Brazil. His research employs mixed methods to identify and implement sustainable physical activity solutions within structured settings.",

Thousands of Yemeni Jews have immigrated to the newly founded Israel in search of a better life. In an overcrowded immigrant camp, a shy young man happens upon a beautiful girl, Saida, singing by the river. In the midst of chaos and uncertainty, they fall in love. But they were not supposed to.1955. Thirty-something Zohara, Saida's daughter, has been living in New York City. She has not looked back since leaving home, rarely in touch with family back in Israel.

This work shows that QUS can detect risk earlier than standard measures, track how the cervix heals after birth, and be automated for easier use in clinics, bringing QUS closer to becoming a practical tool to help prevent preterm birth.Panel IAnnette McCoy: Clinical research offers both opportunities and challenges for the clinician-scientist. This talk will focus on how study design and managing expectations can overcome factors such as biological variability and small sample size to achieve clinically meaningful outcomes.Margarita Teran Garcia: Obesity is a major concern for Hispanic children, shaped by social and structural barriers to healthy living. A USDA-funded trial, Abriendo Caminos, tested a family-based program across multiple U.S. sites. The program helped prevent short-term weight gain, especially among younger children and girls, but benefits faded after 6 months. Culturally tailored programs can spark short-term changes, though more support is needed to sustain long-term healthy habits.Josie Rudolphi: I will focus on using quantitative methods to describe the mental health status, stress, and safety perceptions of various agricultural populations, how advanced quantitative statistics and interdisciplinary collaborations lead to novel research with agricultural producers and workers, and how our research is informing impactful Extension programs.Panel IIQihao Zhan: Qihao is a fourth-year PhD student in the School of Social Work, studying healthy relationships among adolescents. Her presentation examines adolescent dating experiences using data from the Illinois Youth Survey, focusing on the protective role of school climate in dating violence victimization and its implications for prevention practice.Aditya Vaidyam: Aditya Vaidyam, a medical student and digital psychiatry researcher, co-created the LAMP Platform, an open-source tool that connects patient data from phones and wearables with clinical care. With its AI toolkit Cortex, LAMP enables surveys, mindfulness tools, and personalized interventions, improving access and outcomes—especially for people with serious mental illness.Maxwell Wallace: Max is a visiting research project coordinator working with The Illinois Youth Tobacco Survey (ILYTS), a statewide public health survey designed to track youth tobacco use, exposure, and attitudes among middle and high school students. To be a truly representative survey of Illinois youth, careful methodological practices in sampling, data collection, analysis, and dissemination must be employed to understand this health risk accurately. To assist our team with these complex methods, we partnered with the BERD team to reignite the project after nearly a decade, made possible with funding from the Illinois Department of Public Health.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

Does your content change, but the structure of your lesson always remain the same?  If so, you or your students may be getting a bit bored in class. Perhaps you can take a page from the tabletop roleplaying game community to freshen up your approach.The Five-Room Dungeon is a method Gamemasters can use to keep their adventures new and exciting without having to put in a lot of extra work for each session. You don’t need to know anything about these games to understand the approach: a good adventure has a limited number of core elements, and by identifying the core elements of each adventure, and maybe altering the order in which they appear, you’ll end up with a unique adventure every time without wasting much time and effort in the planning stage.In this workshop, we'll apply a similar strategy to identify the core components of a good lesson, and see how different arrangements of core components can create new and interesting lessons.This workshop counts towards the Graduate Teacher Certificate or the Certificate in Foundations of Teaching.",

        "description": "Putin’s Russia, a successor state to the Soviet Union, is challenging American foreign policy by offering a “Multipolar World Order,” an alternative to Western capitalism, liberal democracy, and globalization. While scholars know of the Soviet Union’s successful outreach in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, Russia’s current relations with the Global South have received less attention. We explore both the contemporary and historical influences shaping Russia’s network of multilateral alliances.  These alliances span the globe and include pockets of support in Europe and the United States. Our research has significance for American foreign policy, scholarship, and university curricula.Choi Chatterjee is the co-director of the Urban Ecology Center and an Emerita Professor of History at California State University, Los Angeles. Her most recent book is Russia in World History: A Transnational Approach (2022). She is writing a history of the worldly travels of the Russian Orthodox text The Way of a Pilgrim and how it sparked spiritual conversations in Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and India.Karen Petrone is Professor History at the University of Kentucky, and co-director of the UK-JHF Holocaust Education Initiative.

        "description": "Join us for a HYBRID event with our visiting scholar, Baiheng Qian, from Sun Yat-sen University in China.About the Speaker:Baiheng Qian is a PhD candidate in Classical Chinese Literature at Sun Yat-sen University(Guangzhou), China. Her research interests include Ming-Qing literature and gender studies in late imperial China, with a particular focus on ci poetry of the Ming dynasty.About the TalkThis talk examines women’s ci (詞)—often translated as “lyric,” a fixed-tone poetic form distinct from modern song lyrics—in the mid-to-late Ming dynasty(1522-1644). By exploring the dynamic interplay of morality and sentiment in women’s ci poems, this talk illuminates how the female poets both responded to and helped shape the cultural transformation of late Ming China. While much scholarly attention has been given to women’s literary creativity during the Ming-Qing transition and the flourishing High Qing(1683-1839), the mid-to-late Ming period was in fact a formative moment when female ci poets first established a sustained presence within the lyric tradition. This era was marked by political stagnation at court, the precarious livelihoods of impoverished scholar-officials, and the rise of an increasingly commercialized urban culture fueled by the influx of silver and the expansion of the marketplace. These conditions fostered both hedonistic indulgence and moral rigor—two poles that defined the cultural landscape of late Ming China. Within this context, women’s ci writing was not merely a vehicle of personal expression but also a reflection of broader cultural tensions: between secular pleasure and moral discipline, and between the private intimacy of the boudoir and the public circulation of print. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Free speech and academic freedom are foundational to our university’s missions of discovery and exploration.

        "description": "When lead nuclei collide at nearly the speed of light inside the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, they create the hottest known matter in the universe — the Quark-Gluon Plasma, a state that existed just microseconds after the Big Bang. At the University of Illinois, researchers have developed ultra–radiation-hard detectors capable of withstanding environments far harsher than any nuclear reactor. These detectors help determine how the colliding ions overlap and how the plasma evolves. This lecture will explore how Illinois scientists contribute to the international quest to recreate the matter of the early universe and study matter under the most extreme conditions ever achieved on Earth.",

That is where the EVERYbody Project comes in. This workshop is a body acceptance-based program designed to help students feel better about their bodies as we directly discuss the impact of diversity within cultural appearance ideals (including race, gender identity, sexuality, ability, and age) and critique the individual and collective impact of pursuing exclusive appearance norms. This research-based program has been shown to improve body satisfaction and acceptance among college students and reduce the risks of unhealthy eating behaviors, disordered eating, and eating disorders.The program entails two 90-minute sessions, scheduled one week apart, and is co-led by Counseling Center staff members, graduate assistants, and Counseling Center Paraprofessional undergraduate students. Each session is designed for groups of 6-12 students. To get the most out of the program, individual students and groups are asked to register only if they can attend both 90-minute sessions. As the name suggests, the EVERYbody Project is targeted toward EVERY type of body, meaning students can benefit regardless of gender identity, ethnicity, size, or ability. All registered students are welcome and encouraged to participate!",

        "description": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) pose a significant public health challenge in Brazil, as they do in many parts of the world. Research consistently shows that treatment for SUDs tends to be more effective when adapted to the cultural context of the individuals receiving care. However, most evidence-based interventions are developed in North America and subsequently exported to other countries, often without sufficient attention to cultural differences. The process of culturally adapting these interventions is poorly understood and rarely thoroughly documented. This presentation will describe our efforts to culturally adapt and implement a family-based Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention for Brazilian families. Specifically, we focus on families in which one member is affected by a substance use disorder and another family member participates in their treatment sessions. Additionally, we will present our preliminary outcomes from families that received the intervention.  Doug Smith (Ph.D., LCSW) is Professor of Social Work at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  His research focuses on creating and testing substance use interventions.",

        "description": "This hands-on workshop will help you integrate Audio Description (AD) into your workflow, making visual content accessible from the start rather than as a post-production fix. You'll learn to replace vague cues like “As you can see here” with rich, meaningful descriptions that enhance accessibility and reduce technical hurdles.By the end of this workshop, attendees will be able to:Identify the fundamentals of audio description practiceWrite and voice visual aid descriptions in your disciplineOptimize presentation preparation and workflows to reduce and eliminate audio descriptionIMPORTANT: If you present visuals during teaching/presenting (most often a PowerPoint with images), please bring a sample presentation. We’ll leverage small groups to apply concepts and offer feedback.If your context is more video/media production, bring a representative sample of that work.If you do not have a sample presentation, we’ll guide you in our workshop on alternatives to facilitate your participation.Full Workshop DescriptionAudio Description (AD) is a practice of using words that are succinct, vivid, and imaginative to convey visuals; benefitting people who are blind or have low vision. The visual is made verbal. Producing descriptions after presentations are recorded, or after videos are finalized, incurs many technical hurdles and educational limitations. Conversely, if material is presented with AD included (a variation known as “integrated description”), several post-production and video dissemination steps are assuaged alongside additional benefits! In this workshop, we’ll build skills in writing and integrating description into your existing workflows; turning your inadvertently inaccessible “As you can see here,” into a description rich with context and significance.",

        "description": "In Civilizing Contention, Rana B. Khoury asserts that to understand civilian and refugee activism in war, we must regard the international actors and organizations that enter the scene to help. When these organizations respond to crises, they work with local actors. In so doing, they facilitate the activists' participation in something like a civil society even in the depths of war. Yet as aid imposes its structures and routines, it also leaves activists unprotected from the violence of war and its aftermaths.Khoury pursues these ideas through analysis of Syria's war that emerged from the 2011 Arab Uprisings. She traces the afterlife of a social movement that did not merely take up arms or capitulate to repression. Interviews with Syrian activists and international aid workers in Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon provide insight into action among actors in the war, while original social media data offers additional evidence. Civilizing Contention deepens knowledge of civilian and refugee agency by explaining how ordinary people act in extraordinary ways in a world structured by powerful forces.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "description": "In fourteenth-century Provence, the volume of contracts produced by scribes known as public notaries increased rapidly from thousands each year to millions. By the fifteenth century, virtually all social and economic relations could be guaranteed by a notarial act. Reliance on the written word expanded both geographically and socially, reaching even the region's most remote rural communities and serving the interests of marginalized actors, including women, peasants, and religious minorities. This talk seeks to answer fundamental questions about this extraordinary moment in late medieval law, literacy, and technology: Why did written records become so wildly popular so quickly? What were the consequences of this rapid legal and cultural transformation? And how did the lives and logics of everyday legal actors change as a result?",

Ranging from ancient Greece to seventeenth century France to twentieth century Britain, this exhibit will explore Sappho as poet, muse, and icon.The exhibit, Sweetbitter: The Literary Legacies and Afterlives of Sappho, will be on display in the RBML through May 2025.",

        "description": "Based on findings of a long-term ethnographic study of the integration and other experiences of Bosnians resettled as refugees to two urban environments in the north of New York State, this talk will suggest taking a long-term perspective in studying refugee integration. While the labels \"pre-resettlement\" and \"post-resettlement\" offer analytical convenience when examining this topic, it is helpful to recognize that the integrating individuals may not necessarily be operating on a logic that divides their lives in a \"before-and-after\" manner. Accordingly, the talk will invite attention to the ways in which integration experiences may exhibit a nonlinear or cyclical character. Factors such as difficulties of exit from the origin country and transit through subsequent countries later on may impact individual or collective decision-making in areas of, for instance, home buying in the permanent resettlement country. Likewise, the availability of transferable pre-migration soft & hard skills and capital may lead to variations in naturalization decisions, entrepreneurial activities, and community building initiatives of refugees who may otherwise be similarly positioned in terms of ethno-national-religious backgrounds, reasons for displacement, and types of assistance received, among other attributes.Fethi Keles, PT Instructor, Department of Anthropology, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University",

        "description": "This is a VIRTUAL only event with Dr. Se-Mi Oh. Professor Anna Jungeun Lee (EALC/History) will moderate the talk.About the Speaker:\"I am a cultural historian of modern and contemporary Korea who works across the disciplinary boundaries of urban humanities and visual studies. My research is concerned with the question of how history interacts with space. To be specific, I take the city as the subject of my study and also a method of doing history. This leads me to approach visual and textual manifestations of the city not as a reflection of historical reality but as constitutive of it. As I approach the city as the writing of history, I rely on semiotics in decoding space as language and text and employ interdisciplinary approaches of history, visual/media studies, urban humanities, and art and architecture.\"Read more about Dr. Se-Mi Oh at the link.About the Talk:Nodeul is a man-made island in the Han River that has become a focal point of urban planning debates in recent decades. Once a shifting river sandbank shaped by seasonal flooding, it was transformed into a permanent island in 1917, when the Japanese colonial government raised the bank and reinforced it with stone embankments as part of the Han River footbridge between Yongsan and Noryangjin. Long inconspicuous, Nodeul emerged into public attention in 2005, when Mayor Lee Myung-bak proposed building an opera house on the site. Under Oh Se-hoon, it was rebranded as the “Hangang Arts Island,” a plan abandoned after strong public opposition. Under Park Won-sun, it was reimagined as an urban farm and commons. Today, the Nodeul Dream Island project has brought the site back into the spotlight, with Thomas Heatherwick’s Soundscape winning the most recent international design competition.This presentation traces the shifting visions of Nodeul across these competing projects and asks what they reveal about the island’s status as an urban exception—a space persistently reimagined, yet never fully settled within Seoul’s urban landscape.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Free speech and academic freedom are foundational to our university’s missions of discovery and exploration.

That is where the EVERYbody Project comes in. This workshop is a body acceptance-based program designed to help students feel better about their bodies as we directly discuss the impact of diversity within cultural appearance ideals (including race, gender identity, sexuality, ability, and age) and critique the individual and collective impact of pursuing exclusive appearance norms. This research-based program has been shown to improve body satisfaction and acceptance among college students and reduce the risks of unhealthy eating behaviors, disordered eating, and eating disorders.The program entails two 90-minute sessions, scheduled one week apart, and is co-led by Counseling Center staff members, graduate assistants, and Counseling Center Paraprofessional undergraduate students. Each session is designed for groups of 6-12 students. To get the most out of the program, individual students and groups are asked to register only if they can attend both 90-minute sessions.

        "description": "The RBML is thrilled to host Gillen D’Arcy Wood, who will speak about his new book, The Wake of HMS Challenger: How a Legendary Victorian Voyage Tells the Story of Our Oceans' Decline. Copies of the book will be available for purchase and signing. This event is free and open to the public, and refreshments will be served.In December 1872, HMS Challenger embarked on the first round-the-world oceanographic expedition. Its goal: to shine a light for the first time on the mysteries of the deep sea. For the next four years, Challenger’s naturalists explored the oceans, encountering never-before-seen marvels of marine life. The expedition’s achievements are the stuff of legend. It identified major ocean currents and defining features of the seafloor, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Mariana Trench. It measured worldwide sea temperatures and chemistry, creating baseline data for all ocean research since. And, most spectacularly of all, it collected nearly five thousand sea creatures and plants new to science. In The Wake of HMS Challenger, Gillen D’Arcy Wood looks afresh at this legendary scientific odyssey and shows why, 150 years later, its legacy looms larger than ever.The Challenger’s scientists had no way of knowing that the incredible undersea aquarium they were documenting was on the verge of catastrophic change. Off Portugal, they encountered a brilliant starfish now threatened with extinction by microplastics; in St. Thomas, teeming coral habitats that today have been decimated by ocean warming; and at remote Ascension Island, the breeding grounds of the now-endangered green turtle. Lyrical and elegiac, The Wake of HMS Challenger offers a stunning before-and-after picture of our global oceans. It is both a reminder of what we have lost since the Victorian age and an urgent call to preserve what remains of the diverse life and wild beauty of our planet’s final frontier.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "title": "Library Friends Webinar - Enduring Narratives: Writers and Preservationists in Collaboration",
        "description": "A Special Presentation by Josh Harris, Kim Schmidt, and Abigail Bobrow             What happens when writers, archivists, and preservationists join forces? At the University of Illinois, this partnership transforms ordinary records into stories that bridge generations. Writers capture the immediacy of campus life through interviews, profiles, and features while archivists and preservationists safeguard context, accuracy, and continuity. Together, they ensure that today’s voices remain accessible tomorrow.This session highlights how collaboration strengthens storytelling. We’ll explore how writers can draw from archival collections to enrich narratives, how archivists prepare today’s materials for future researchers, and how preservationists keep fragile or digital content from being lost. The conversation will emphasize strategies that balance creativity with stewardship, showing how each role supports the other.Examples include using rare photographs to inspire and illustrate contemporary feature stories, capturing oral histories before memories fade, and creating digital repositories that meet both communications needs and scholarly standards. These efforts demonstrate how short-term storytelling can build long-term institutional memory.By valuing both creativity and preservation, universities can ensure their stories endure. Attendees will leave with ideas for fostering partnerships that not only document the present but also preserve it for the future.Josh Harris is the head of Media Preservation since its inception in 2011 within the University Library. Josh oversees the preservation of the library’s sound recordings, motion picture films, and videotapes through conservation, preservation, and digitization. Josh is also secretary-general for the Southeast Asia-Pacific Audiovisual Archive Association.Kim Schmidt is the storytelling director in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement, responsible for overseeing creative content produced for donors and friends. She is the founding editor of STORIED magazine. Kim received her master’s degree in journalism from Illinois in 2017.Abigail Bobrow is the associate director of storytelling in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Institutional Advancement. She is responsible for creating stories, videos, and photography for STORIED, a campus-level print magazine and website. Abigail also serves as the chair of the University of Illinois Web Conference, a two-day virtual event that brings together web professionals from around the world. Abigail received her master’s degree in journalism from the University of Illinois in 2019.",

        "description": "A Time for the Province proposes innovative readings of historical and contemporary Polish borderlands as a complex dialogic zone, offering new ways of connecting the Polish past(s) with the country’s present and its future. Across seven chapters, as the study dives into narratives by some of Poland’s most iconic modern authors, including the 2018 Nobel Laureate Olga Tokarczuk, it engages with fields of memory and postmemory studies, postsocialist studies, Holocaust history, Jewish-Polish relations, and ethnic and migration studies. Drawing on writings of such contemporary Polish critics as Przemysław Czapliński and Krzysztof Czyżewski, postcolonial theorists including Homi Bhabha and Edward Said, and philosophers of the human environment such as Gaston Bachelard, A Time for the Province revises and complicates traditional conceptions of what the province and the borderland represent and perform within Polish literary and cultural practice, reframing this space as both a contact zone and a palimpsest.George Gasyna is Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures and Comparative and World Literature at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and editor in chief of the Slavic & East European Journal (SEEJ). Born in Łódź, Poland, he and his family emigrated to Ontario, Canada – home of one of the largest and most vibrant Polish diasporas in North America – when he was 12. Prof. Gasyna holds a BA and an MA in Russian and Slavic Studies from McGill University in Montreal, and a PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of Toronto (2005). Specializing in Polish literature of the 20th century, his work engages with a number of adjacent fields including émigré and exilic discourses, heritage and diaspora studies, and Polish-Jewish relations, as well as travel writing and memoir. Prof. Gasyna is author of Polish, Hybrid, and Otherwise: Exilic Discourse in Joseph Conrad and Witold Gombrowicz (London: Bloomsbury, 2011), and editor for the volume of essays Joseph Conrad’s Polish Soul: Realms of Memory and Self (2016). His scholarship has appeared in a number of critical collections and journals including Slavic Review, Canadian Slavonic Papers, Polish Review, and Russian Literature. His most recent book, A Time for the Province: Palimpsests and Borders in Twentieth-Century Polish Literature, was published in spring 2025 by McGill-Queen's University Press.",

        "description": "Join us for a CEAPS Brown Bag with PhD student Conference Travel Grant recipients Jiwon Oh and Darren ChuangAbout the SpeakersJiwon Jenn Oh is a PhD Student at the University of Illinois in the Institute of Communications Research. Her research interests broadly encompass transnational and feminist STS, AI ethics and governance, and East Asian technocultures, with a particular focus on the cultural and political life of AI and how discourses of innovation, intimacy, and governance are entangled in the production of relational AI. She holds an M.A. in Communication from Seoul National University, and a B.S. in Media, Culture, and Communication from New York University. Darren (Sheng-Hsuan) Chuang is a second-year PhD student in Musicology at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. His research lies at the intersection of ethnomusicology, popular music studies, Taiwan and East Asian studies, and gender studies. He is particularly interested in how Taiwanese popular music both reflects and shapes expressions of Taiwanese masculinities, especially as they intersect with class, cultural identity, and national discourses within broader East Asian and global contexts. Before pursuing his PhD at U of I, he earned his BA in Chinese Literature from National Cheng Kung University (Taiwan), a dual MA in Arts and Humanities Education and Musicology from Taipei National University of the Arts (Taiwan), and an MPhil in Music Studies from Wolfson College, University of Cambridge (United Kingdom). About \"Navigating Gendered Anthropomorphism in AI Ethics”The Lee Luda controversy was a pivotal moment that inaugurated nationwide discourses surrounding AI ethics in South Korea. As a conversational chatbot designed to simulate lifelike conversations, Luda quickly gained attention for its human-like interaction capabilities but soon became the center of controversy due to its use of private human conversations for training, leading to unintended disclosures of personal details and generating responses filled with hate speech and sexual content manipulation. This incident prompted widespread public concern and regulatory scrutiny, leading to suspension of the service and subsequent fines imposed by the government. In response, ScatterLab introduced an ‘AI Chatbot Ethics Checklist’ to address ethical concerns in AI development. This study examines the aftermath of the Lee Luda incident, focusing on ScatterLab’s ethical response and the broader implications for AI ethics and gender in Korea, underscoring the need for inclusive and ethical AI design practices to mitigate biases in AI technologies. About \"Sailing in Sonic Vortex: Close Listening to Taike Tunes in Taiwan’s Post-Martial Law Music Scene\"Taiwan possesses a unique and fluid sociocultural landscape that shapes its musical sphere into a “sonic vortex.” Since the post-martial law era, amid processes of internal sociocultural opening, transformation, and contestation, as well as shifting geopolitics and accelerating globalization, Taiwanese popular music has gained renewed momentum, intricately weaving together diverse cultural symbols and emerging through interconnections with musical flows from East Asia and beyond. Against this backdrop, this paper examines how Taiwanese music articulates both inter-Asian connections and a localized form of globality, while also demonstrating how it reflects, and even participates in, Taiwan’s complex history of successive colonial regimes. Focusing on case studies that vocalize taike / 8+9 culture—a subculture renowned for its performances of distinct Taiwanese masculinities and expressions of Taiwaneseness—I approach music as a multilayered text of verbal, sonic, and visual symbols, employing musical semiotics in dialogue with inter-Asian studies and global history. In doing so, through the analysis of both verbal and non-verbal symbols, I aim to reposition the musical object itself—the sound—as an indispensable component of popular music studies. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Free speech and academic freedom are foundational to our university’s missions of discovery and exploration.

        "description": "Did you know the internet runs on light?Every time you send an email or stream a video, bright pulses of light travel through underground fiber-optic cables — the invisible highways of the internet. These light pulses carry the 1s and 0s that computers use to store and share information.Now, imagine doing this with individual particles of light, called photons. That’s the idea behind a quantum network. Instead of just sending data, quantum networks use the strange and powerful rules of quantum mechanics — the science of how the universe behaves at the tiniest scales.In a quantum network, photons can be entangled, meaning they behave like a single connected system even when separated by great distances. Changing or measuring one instantly influences the other. Researchers around the world are exploring how this property can power next-generation communication systems and connect emerging quantum technologies like quantum computers and sensors.With the Public Quantum Network (PQN), we want everyone — not just scientists — to be part of this new frontier. PQN brings entangled photons to public spaces such as libraries and schools using the same fiber-optic cables that already carry the internet.The first section of the Public Quantum Network launched at The Urbana Free Library in 2023. This presentation will take you behind the scenes of how it was built and share ongoing efforts to make the network reliable, interactive, and open source — so anyone can explore the quantum internet of the future.",

Join her on an adventure across time and the tools of history to re-discover the women of the ancient world.Copies of Hauser's recent books Penelope’s Bones: A New History of Homer’s World through the Women Written Out of It and How Women Became Poets: A Gender History of Greek Literature will be available onsite for purchase and signing.

Students are encouraged to begin application drafts prior to leaving for winter break.  The Boren provides study abroad scholarships of up to $25,000 for a full academic year or $12,500 for a semester. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students also have the option of applying for summer-only programs of eight weeks or more. All scholarships may be used for U.S. citizens to study in Asia, Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East on almost any study abroad program. These are merit-based scholarships (approximately 1 in 5 eligible applicants receive awards). In order to receive the scholarship, award winners must enter into a service agreement requiring that they attempt to work in a paid position for the federal government in an area related to national security—generally the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, or the Intelligence Community within three years of graduation (deferrals possible/encouraged for graduate study). Working for USAID or tenure in the Peace Corps counts in the service requirement. Winners also receive priority-hiring status.  The Boren information session will be held on October 23, 2025 from 3:30-4:30 p.m. and the Boren workshop will be held on October 24th from 3:00-4:00 pm. Both sessions will be held in room 514 IUB. There will also be an additional ONLINE Information Session held on October 24th from 9:00-10:00 if you are unable to attend in person.For more information, contact the scholarships office at topscholars@illinois.edu or visit our website at Boren Scholarship – National & International Scholarships Program",

        "description": "The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is hosting its monthly colloquium series and invites everyone to participate in the October session. This month's event will be led by William K. M. Lai, Assistant Research Professor in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Computational Biology at Cornell. William directs both the Cornell Center for Vertebrate Genomics and the Cornell EpiGenomics Core Facility. His research group integrates novel genomic assays and custom bioinformatic algorithms, often leveraging machine learning and explainable AI, to dissect how protein-DNA interactions vary across cell states and contribute to disease.Title: Poisoning of networks with adversarial particle swarm optimizationAbstract:We present Adversarial Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) as a black-box optimization-based approach for crafting poisoned data. Poisoned data is a significant threat to the reliability and security of deep learning systems. Unlike prior poisoning methods, APSO leverages swarm intelligence to efficiently search for perturbations that reduce target model performance without any a priori knowledge of training data or access to the model weights and biases. We evaluate APSO on models trained to classify MNIST, CIFAR-10, and AudioMNIST using a variety of architectures and adversarial hardening techniques and demonstrate APSO’s ability to quantify model resilience to adversarial attack. We also investigate the feasibility of black-box transfer attacks wherein attacks performed on one model transfer their poisoning to another. The results highlight a critical concern: the transferability of poisoned data, which poses a potential risk for real-world AI systems, where poisoned data can propagate undetected across diverse models and architectures. These findings underscore the need for enhanced defense mechanisms to safeguard against adversarial threats in multi-model environment.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "description": "This symposium will explore artistic production, practices, and the agency of printed media before 1750 as they intersect with themes of sexuality and gender.Conceptions of sexuality and gender underwent profound changes in Europe during the premodern era (roughly 1300–1750) and were an important avenue of exploration for printmakers. In art prints, broadsheets, fashion plates, and anatomies alike, human subjects were fashioned and viewed in conversation with cultural attitudes and beliefs about gender and sexuality. Canonical works such as Albrecht Dürer’s \"Adam and Eve\" and Henrick Goltzius’s \"Farnese Hercules as Seen from Behind\" not only convey notions of artistic excellence but also their ideas about idealized bodies, gender roles, and sexuality. Additionally, gender and sexuality had profound effects on artistic practices and training. In a time when many women were precluded from traditional apprenticeships and professional guilds, printmaking could present alternative paths to collaboration and network building. Moreover, as an artform linked with the broad circulation of knowledge but also with intimate, private viewing, prints open doors to consider how artists and beholders conceived of their own experiences of gender and sexuality in and outside of social norms.This symposium focused on sexuality and gender is being held in conjunction with Imagination, Faith, and Desire: Art and Agency in European Prints, 1475–1800, curated by Maureen Warren, Curator of European and American Art, and on view at Krannert Art Museum from Sep 25, 2025–Feb 28, 2026.The event will be hybrid, blending in-person presentations with online presentations via Zoom to make the event more equitable and permit international participation and will also include a walk-through of the exhibition.The keynote speaker will be Dr. Nicole Cook, Senior Program Manager at the Center for Netherlandish Art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Dr. Cook will share her research about seventeenth-century Dutch prints of “nightwalkers” and how they envisage a space for gender nonconformity.Speakers include:• Saskia Beranek, Ph.D., Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts, Illinois State University• Sunmin Cha, Ph.D. Candidate, Columbia University, New York• Kendra Grimmett, Ph.D., Ball State University• Darja (Daria) Kocerova, Ph.D. Candidate, The Warburg Institution, London• Tatiana C.

Arts and crafts include disciplines such as ceramics, textiles, woodworking, lacquerware, papermaking, and other means of artistic expression that involve considerable understanding of traditional methods and techniques. Artisans hone their skills to create objects that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Kogei artists and their produced objects are valued for their rich history that reflect intangible cultural heritage spanning hundreds of years, as techniques and processes are passed down from generation to generation. A category of kogei is mingei, (民芸), which translates to “folk crafts,” and is formed from minshu (民衆), meaning common people, and kogei (工芸). Art critic and philosopher Soetsu Yanagi created this term and the mingei movement in the 1920/30s to distinguish the value of everyday items made for ordinary use for the common person.The Kogei exhibition and programming are supported by the Japan Foundation New York through the U.S.-Japan Community Grassroots Exchange Program. Japan House is proud to highlight the traditional arts and crafts of Fukushima and feature the stories of Fukushima. Japan House acknowledges support from the Illinois Arts Council for this program. In addition, Chiba is a George A. Miller Visiting Artist supported by the Center for Advanced Study at the University of Illinois.FAQsWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?Japan House is located in the Arboretum at the University of Illinois at 2000 S.

        "description": "Japan House is pleased to host a Japanese calligraphy (shodo) workshop featuring Fukushima artist Seiran Chiba as part of the Kogei: Traditional Arts and Crafts project. Guests will learn about the basics of Japanese calligraphy and practice writing with her guidance before creating their own masterpiece.Shodo is the “the way of writing,” and it is also referred to as shuji, or calligraphy. Writing becomes elevated as an art form and means of expression through the study and practice of penmanship. Thus, the spirit of the brush becomes alive and reflects the kokoro (heart, mind, and spirit) of the artist. The Japanese writing system utilizes kanji, or Chinese characters, and a single ideogram can convey a concept or idea. Calligraphy can be used on materials beyond paper or canvas such as on ceramics. Looking closely, each stroke is deliberately executed to create an evocative and emotional message with just a few characters.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop. Guests will be provided with supplies but are asked to wear dark clothing that they don't mind getting ink on.________Seiran Chiba is a world-renowned Japanese shodo (calligraphy) artist from Fukushima, Japan.

In 2020, she provided calligraphy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic commemorative monument, and in 2024, she won the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award at the 2024 National Open Calligraphy Exhibition.Chiba has a modern approach to large-scale calligraphy inspired by hope and peace through her performances. In Japan, she taught calligraphy to adults and children living in temporary housing that remained after the 2011 tsunami. Through calligraphy, she teaches the importance of expressing one’s feelings and travels all over Japan with her calligraphy brush to share the beauty and strength of the Fukushima people despite the continued hardships that they still incur. Chiba visited Japan House in 2013 and 2018 for demonstrations and workshops with the local, university, and K-12 communities. She was a featured artist for Japan House’s Matsuri in 2018. In 2023, Japan House received the Education Grant from the Japan Foundation New York to support Chiba for an artist residency to teach calligraphy in Urbana-Champaign and perform at Matsuri. Chiba returned in 2024 to host workshops in Urbana-Champaign and was the featured artist for Gardens for Peace at Japan House. She continues to make visits to the United States to share her story and that of Fukushima through performances and workshops at numerous organizations.________Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts.

Guests will learn about the aizome craft process and history, then they can learn to stencil dye a Japanese paper fan to take home!Aizome is a traditional dyeing technique that uses indigo plants to color fabrics a deep blue (indigo) hue. In Fukushima Prefecture, indigo production thrived in areas such as Aizubange Town and Minamiaizu Town, reaching its peak during the Meiji era (around 1900). Even today, traditional indigo dyeing techniques are preserved in Minamiaizu and other parts of the region. One notable example of Aizome’s cultural significance is its connection to local festivals. The Tajima Gion Festival, held in Minamiaizu, features traditional men's attire (asa-kamishimo, hemp ceremonial robes) dyed using locally produced indigo by skilled artisans. This highlights the deep ties between indigo dyeing and regional traditions. Additionally, stencil dyeing techniques using katagami (dye paper stencils) were widely practiced, allowing artisans to create intricate fabric patterns. In the Aizu region of Fukushima Prefecture, a unique style of stencil known as Aizugata was developed and produced from the Edo period to the early Showa era. Today, Aizugata remains a cherished design, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern aesthetics.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop.

Arts and crafts include disciplines such as ceramics, textiles, woodworking, lacquerware, papermaking, and other means of artistic expression that involve considerable understanding of traditional methods and techniques. Artisans hone their skills to create objects that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Kogei artists and their produced objects are valued for their rich history that reflect intangible cultural heritage spanning hundreds of years, as techniques and processes are passed down from generation to generation. A category of kogei is mingei, (民芸), which translates to “folk crafts,” and is formed from minshu (民衆), meaning common people, and kogei (工芸). Art critic and philosopher Soetsu Yanagi created this term and the mingei movement in the 1920/30s to distinguish the value of everyday items made for ordinary use for the common person.The Kogei exhibition and programming are supported by the Japan Foundation New York through the U.S.-Japan Community Grassroots Exchange Program. Japan House is proud to highlight the traditional arts and crafts of Fukushima and feature the stories of Fukushima. This program is also partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council through federal funds provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.",

Students are encouraged to begin application drafts prior to leaving for winter break.  The Boren provides study abroad scholarships of up to $25,000 for a full academic year or $12,500 for a semester. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students also have the option of applying for summer-only programs of eight weeks or more. All scholarships may be used for U.S. citizens to study in Asia, Africa, Central & Eastern Europe, Latin America, or the Middle East on almost any study abroad program. These are merit-based scholarships (approximately 1 in 5 eligible applicants receive awards). In order to receive the scholarship, award winners must enter into a service agreement requiring that they attempt to work in a paid position for the federal government in an area related to national security—generally the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, or the Intelligence Community within three years of graduation (deferrals possible/encouraged for graduate study). Working for USAID or tenure in the Peace Corps counts in the service requirement. Winners also receive priority-hiring status.  The Boren information session will be held on October 23, 2025 from 3:30-4:30 p.m. and the Boren workshop will be held on October 24th from 3:00-4:00 pm. Both sessions will be held in room 514 IUB. There will also be an additional ONLINE Information Session held on October 24th from 9:00-10:00 if you are unable to attend in person.For more information, contact the scholarships office at topscholars@illinois.edu or visit our website at Boren Scholarship – National & International Scholarships Program",

She is the creator and author of the blog Native Appropriations, the co-creator of the All My Relations Podcast, and the author of Notable Native People: 50 Indigenous Leaders, Dreamers, and Changemakers from Past and Present. In her visual arts practice, she uses traditional Cherokee art forms like basketry, beadwork, and twining with contemporary and found materials, using non-traditional, recycled materials, LED lights, and electroluminescent wire. Her visual work is about reclamation and restoration of cultural practices and identity while weaving an Indigenous future that holds the contradictions and joys of who she is as an Indigenous person.

        "description": "Japan House is pleased to host an aizome (indigo dyeing) workshop featuring Fukushima artist Hirohisa Saito as part of the Kogei: Traditional Arts and Crafts project. Guests will learn about the aizome craft process and history, then they can learn to stencil dye a Japanese paper fan to take home!Aizome is a traditional dyeing technique that uses indigo plants to color fabrics a deep blue (indigo) hue. In Fukushima Prefecture, indigo production thrived in areas such as Aizubange Town and Minamiaizu Town, reaching its peak during the Meiji era (around 1900). Even today, traditional indigo dyeing techniques are preserved in Minamiaizu and other parts of the region. One notable example of Aizome’s cultural significance is its connection to local festivals. The Tajima Gion Festival, held in Minamiaizu, features traditional men's attire (asa-kamishimo, hemp ceremonial robes) dyed using locally produced indigo by skilled artisans. This highlights the deep ties between indigo dyeing and regional traditions. Additionally, stencil dyeing techniques using katagami (dye paper stencils) were widely practiced, allowing artisans to create intricate fabric patterns. In the Aizu region of Fukushima Prefecture, a unique style of stencil known as Aizugata was developed and produced from the Edo period to the early Showa era. Today, Aizugata remains a cherished design, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern aesthetics.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop. Guests will be provided with all supplies but are asked to wear clothing that they don't mind getting ink on.________Hirohisa Saito is a printmaker and aizome (Japanese indigo dyeing) artist with nearly 40 years of experience in the field. He graduated from Nihon University College of Art in 1981 and completed additional studies at Nihon University College of Art's Art Research Institute in 1983. In 1985, he established Saito Graphic Arts. Saito spent two years in Los Angeles from 1989 as an Overseas Research Fellow for the Agency for Cultural Affairs to study screen printing. His works have been featured in solo exhibitions at various galleries and received various awards. As an educator, he is a part-time lecturer at Koriyama Women's University and a part-time lecturer at Tokyo University of the Arts. He is a Member of the Saitama Prefecture Art Association, Vice President of the Saitama Prefecture Printmakers’ Association, and Auditor of the Fukushima Watercolor Painting Association.________Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts. Arts and crafts include disciplines such as ceramics, textiles, woodworking, lacquerware, papermaking, and other means of artistic expression that involve considerable understanding of traditional methods and techniques. Artisans hone their skills to create objects that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Kogei artists and their produced objects are valued for their rich history that reflect intangible cultural heritage spanning hundreds of years, as techniques and processes are passed down from generation to generation. A category of kogei is mingei, (民芸), which translates to “folk crafts,” and is formed from minshu (民衆), meaning common people, and kogei (工芸). Art critic and philosopher Soetsu Yanagi created this term and the mingei movement in the 1920/30s to distinguish the value of everyday items made for ordinary use for the common person.The Kogei exhibition and programming are supported by the Japan Foundation New York through the U.S.-Japan Community Grassroots Exchange Program. Japan House is proud to highlight the traditional arts and crafts of Fukushima and feature the stories of Fukushima. This program is also partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council through federal funds provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.",

        "description": "Japan House is pleased to host a Japanese calligraphy (shodo) workshop featuring Fukushima artist Seiran Chiba as part of the Kogei: Traditional Arts and Crafts project. Guests will learn about the basics of Japanese calligraphy and practice writing with her guidance before creating their own masterpiece.Shodo is the “the way of writing,” and it is also referred to as shuji, or calligraphy. Writing becomes elevated as an art form and means of expression through the study and practice of penmanship. Thus, the spirit of the brush becomes alive and reflects the kokoro (heart, mind, and spirit) of the artist. The Japanese writing system utilizes kanji, or Chinese characters, and a single ideogram can convey a concept or idea. Calligraphy can be used on materials beyond paper or canvas such as on ceramics. Looking closely, each stroke is deliberately executed to create an evocative and emotional message with just a few characters.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop. Guests will be provided with supplies but are asked to wear dark clothing that they don't mind getting ink on.________Seiran Chiba is a world-renowned Japanese shodo (calligraphy) artist from Fukushima, Japan. Born in Tokyo, she now resides in Fukushima, and she is a Cultural Ambassador for the Fukushima Tourism Exchange. She is active as a traveling calligrapher, embarking on journeys such as the ‘Calligraphy Tour of All 59 Municipalities in Fukushima Prefecture’ and the ‘Japanese Calligraphy Journey.’ Since 2013, she has been conducting large-scale calligraphy demonstrations and workshops at overseas educational institutions. In 2020, she provided calligraphy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic commemorative monument, and in 2024, she won the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Award at the 2024 National Open Calligraphy Exhibition.Chiba has a modern approach to large-scale calligraphy inspired by hope and peace through her performances. In Japan, she taught calligraphy to adults and children living in temporary housing that remained after the 2011 tsunami. Through calligraphy, she teaches the importance of expressing one’s feelings and travels all over Japan with her calligraphy brush to share the beauty and strength of the Fukushima people despite the continued hardships that they still incur. Chiba visited Japan House in 2013 and 2018 for demonstrations and workshops with the local, university, and K-12 communities. She was a featured artist for Japan House’s Matsuri in 2018. In 2023, Japan House received the Education Grant from the Japan Foundation New York to support Chiba for an artist residency to teach calligraphy in Urbana-Champaign and perform at Matsuri. Chiba returned in 2024 to host workshops in Urbana-Champaign and was the featured artist for Gardens for Peace at Japan House. She continues to make visits to the United States to share her story and that of Fukushima through performances and workshops at numerous organizations.________Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts.

        "description": "The war diary, the most prominent genre at the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, reconfigures typical genre features, such as the focus on the self and the dynamic between the speaker and the addressee. It retains the dedication to contemporaneity and the chronological linearity of the narrative, which is presented as artless, private, and authentic, but prioritizes authenticity over other expectations. I examine the ways diarists position themselves as voices of the national collective, rely on the assumption of truthfulness, and construct the temporality of crisis and trauma.  This study contributes to the development of a theoretical framework for analyzing writings that emerge from crisis and impact our understanding of the workings of genres, trauma, and narrative in the digital age.Lyudmila Parts is Professor of Russian in the Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at McGill University (Montreal).

It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "description": "Putin’s Russia, a successor state to the Soviet Union, is challenging American foreign policy by offering a “Multipolar World Order,” an alternative to Western capitalism, liberal democracy, and globalization. While scholars know of the Soviet Union’s successful outreach in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, Russia’s current relations with the Global South have received less attention. We explore both the contemporary and historical influences shaping Russia’s network of multilateral alliances.  These alliances span the globe and include pockets of support in Europe and the United States. Our research has significance for American foreign policy, scholarship, and university curricula.Choi Chatterjee is the co-director of the Urban Ecology Center and an Emerita Professor of History at California State University, Los Angeles. Her most recent book is Russia in World History: A Transnational Approach (2022). She is writing a history of the worldly travels of the Russian Orthodox text The Way of a Pilgrim and how it sparked spiritual conversations in Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and India.Karen Petrone is Professor History at the University of Kentucky, and co-director of the UK-JHF Holocaust Education Initiative.

        "description": "In Civilizing Contention, Rana B. Khoury asserts that to understand civilian and refugee activism in war, we must regard the international actors and organizations that enter the scene to help. When these organizations respond to crises, they work with local actors. In so doing, they facilitate the activists' participation in something like a civil society even in the depths of war. Yet as aid imposes its structures and routines, it also leaves activists unprotected from the violence of war and its aftermaths.Khoury pursues these ideas through analysis of Syria's war that emerged from the 2011 Arab Uprisings. She traces the afterlife of a social movement that did not merely take up arms or capitulate to repression. Interviews with Syrian activists and international aid workers in Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon provide insight into action among actors in the war, while original social media data offers additional evidence. Civilizing Contention deepens knowledge of civilian and refugee agency by explaining how ordinary people act in extraordinary ways in a world structured by powerful forces.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays. For any questions about accessibility or food allergies, please email japanhouse@illinois.eduWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?Japan House is located in the Arboretum at the University of Illinois at 2000 S.

        "description": "Based on findings of a long-term ethnographic study of the integration and other experiences of Bosnians resettled as refugees to two urban environments in the north of New York State, this talk will suggest taking a long-term perspective in studying refugee integration. While the labels \"pre-resettlement\" and \"post-resettlement\" offer analytical convenience when examining this topic, it is helpful to recognize that the integrating individuals may not necessarily be operating on a logic that divides their lives in a \"before-and-after\" manner. Accordingly, the talk will invite attention to the ways in which integration experiences may exhibit a nonlinear or cyclical character. Factors such as difficulties of exit from the origin country and transit through subsequent countries later on may impact individual or collective decision-making in areas of, for instance, home buying in the permanent resettlement country. Likewise, the availability of transferable pre-migration soft & hard skills and capital may lead to variations in naturalization decisions, entrepreneurial activities, and community building initiatives of refugees who may otherwise be similarly positioned in terms of ethno-national-religious backgrounds, reasons for displacement, and types of assistance received, among other attributes.Fethi Keles, PT Instructor, Department of Anthropology, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "description": "A Time for the Province proposes innovative readings of historical and contemporary Polish borderlands as a complex dialogic zone, offering new ways of connecting the Polish past(s) with the country’s present and its future. Across seven chapters, as the study dives into narratives by some of Poland’s most iconic modern authors, including the 2018 Nobel Laureate Olga Tokarczuk, it engages with fields of memory and postmemory studies, postsocialist studies, Holocaust history, Jewish-Polish relations, and ethnic and migration studies. Drawing on writings of such contemporary Polish critics as Przemysław Czapliński and Krzysztof Czyżewski, postcolonial theorists including Homi Bhabha and Edward Said, and philosophers of the human environment such as Gaston Bachelard, A Time for the Province revises and complicates traditional conceptions of what the province and the borderland represent and perform within Polish literary and cultural practice, reframing this space as both a contact zone and a palimpsest.George Gasyna is Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures and Comparative and World Literature at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and editor in chief of the Slavic & East European Journal (SEEJ). Born in Łódź, Poland, he and his family emigrated to Ontario, Canada – home of one of the largest and most vibrant Polish diasporas in North America – when he was 12. Prof. Gasyna holds a BA and an MA in Russian and Slavic Studies from McGill University in Montreal, and a PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of Toronto (2005). Specializing in Polish literature of the 20th century, his work engages with a number of adjacent fields including émigré and exilic discourses, heritage and diaspora studies, and Polish-Jewish relations, as well as travel writing and memoir. Prof. Gasyna is author of Polish, Hybrid, and Otherwise: Exilic Discourse in Joseph Conrad and Witold Gombrowicz (London: Bloomsbury, 2011), and editor for the volume of essays Joseph Conrad’s Polish Soul: Realms of Memory and Self (2016). His scholarship has appeared in a number of critical collections and journals including Slavic Review, Canadian Slavonic Papers, Polish Review, and Russian Literature. His most recent book, A Time for the Province: Palimpsests and Borders in Twentieth-Century Polish Literature, was published in spring 2025 by McGill-Queen's University Press.",

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.  For International Education Week, we are pleased to showcase ryūrei tea ceremony in the spirit of international collaboration.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available. Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance.

        "title": "Japanese Tea Ceremony",
        "description": "Chado, or the Way of Tea, is one of the most ancient and revered arts of Japan and is at the very heart of Japan House. It is a ceremonial way of preparing and serving matcha (powdered green tea) that benefits both the host and the guest through mutual respect, non-verbal communication, and a calmness, or sense of peace, away from everyday life.There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called ryūrei style, or table-style tea ceremony.Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on elevated tatami flooring for most everything, even to eat meals. The ryūrei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seichū (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke School of Tea, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan for the first time during this expo, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.The main feature of ryūrei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the ryūrei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony seated on tatami using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the ryūrei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs and is more physically accessible.We will be alternating weekly between ryūrei (sitting on chairs) and on tatami mats (sitting cross-legged on the tearoom floor).Seated on tatami mats, sitting cross-legged or kneelingOctober 15October 29November 8 (Saturday)Ryūrei style - seated on chairsSeptember 24October 1November 5November 19__________What To ExpectAfter a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of tranquility while learning about proper guest etiquette and the hundreds of years of tradition carried through tea ceremony. Each week, the wagashi will change according to what seasonal ingredients are available.Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop for select items to support our paid internship program. Cash and credit cards are accepted.Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbooks \"Wagashi: Season by Season\" and \"The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes\" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the intimate nature of the tea ceremony. Space is limited.Regarding attire: all guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear clean, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that attendees dress modestly and legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. Bags and electronic devices can be securely stored in our front cubbies.Please do not be late - once the tea ceremony begins, entry will not be permitted as it is disruptive to the experience.Regarding parking and getting to the entrance: due to construction of the Ogura-Sato Annex adjacent to the building, we suggest parking at F-31 (north lot) and walking 5-7 minutes to get to the north entrance. The south entrance is inaccessible due to construction fencing. For guests who opt to park at F-32 (south lot), please note that you will have to walk over a small hill to get to the sidewalk that leads to the north entrance. We will update the map below accordingly. Thank you for your understanding.FAQsWhy is tea ceremony sometimes served Ryūrei (table style) and not the traditional style on the tatami mats?In order to accommodate guests of all ages and ranges of mobility, we offer a style of tea ceremony where all guests sit on chairs. Tea ceremonies where guests sit on tatami are held on alternating Wednesdays.

        "title": "Symposium | Envisioning Gender and Sexuality in Premodern European Prints",
        "description": "This symposium will explore artistic production, practices, and the agency of printed media before 1750 as they intersect with themes of sexuality and gender.Conceptions of sexuality and gender underwent profound changes in Europe during the premodern era (roughly 1300–1750) and were an important avenue of exploration for printmakers. In art prints, broadsheets, fashion plates, and anatomies alike, human subjects were fashioned and viewed in conversation with cultural attitudes and beliefs about gender and sexuality. Canonical works such as Albrecht Dürer’s Adam and Eve and Henrick Goltzius’s Farnese Hercules as Seen from Behind not only convey notions of artistic excellence but also their ideas about idealized bodies, gender roles, and sexuality. Additionally, gender and sexuality had profound effects on artistic practices and training. In a time when many women were precluded from traditional apprenticeships and professional guilds, printmaking could present alternative paths to collaboration and network building. Moreover, as an artform linked with the broad circulation of knowledge but also with intimate, private viewing, prints open doors to consider how artists and beholders conceived of their own experiences of gender and sexuality in and outside of social norms.This symposium focused on sexuality and gender, is being held in conjunction with Imagination, Faith, and Desire: Art and Agency in European Prints, 1475–1800, curated by Maureen Warren, and on view at Krannert Art Museum from Sep 25, 2025–Feb 26, 2026.The event will be hybrid, blending in-person presentations with online presentations via Zoom to make the event more equitable and permit international participation and will also include a walk-through of the exhibition. The talks will be projected for viewing together at the museum, from 10 am–4 pm, with a tour of the exhibition* to follow.The keynote speaker will be Dr. Nicole Cook, Senior Program Manager at the Center for Netherlandish Art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Dr. Cook will share her research about seventeenth-century Dutch prints of “nightwalkers” and how they envisage a space for gender nonconformity.Speakers include:• Saskia Beranek, Ph.D., Wonsook Kim College of Fine Arts, Illinois State University• Sunmin Cha, Ph.D. Candidate, Columbia University, New York• Kendra Grimmett, Ph.D., Ball State University• Darja (Daria) Kocerova, Ph.D. Candidate, The Warburg Institution, London• Tatiana C.

        "description": "This symposium will explore artistic production, practices, and the agency of printed media before 1750 as they intersect with themes of sexuality and gender.Conceptions of sexuality and gender underwent profound changes in Europe during the premodern era (roughly 1300–1750) and were an important avenue of exploration for printmakers. In art prints, broadsheets, fashion plates, and anatomies alike, human subjects were fashioned and viewed in conversation with cultural attitudes and beliefs about gender and sexuality. Canonical works such as Albrecht Dürer’s \"Adam and Eve\" and Henrick Goltzius’s \"Farnese Hercules as Seen from Behind\" not only convey notions of artistic excellence but also their ideas about idealized bodies, gender roles, and sexuality. Additionally, gender and sexuality had profound effects on artistic practices and training. In a time when many women were precluded from traditional apprenticeships and professional guilds, printmaking could present alternative paths to collaboration and network building.

        "description": "Cultural convergence and expansive world views are major themes within the architectural structures, figure sculpture, paintings, and singular hybrid sculptures I build. I seek to insert personal biographical elements along with aspects of mass culture (advertising, fashion, sports, comics, television, and movies). My works attempt to address our connections and disconnections within a turbulent human history. Not all the signs and images used are clearly identifiable or penetrable. My formal and conceptual practices involve the gestures of collecting, repositioning, or reshaping existing objects for new interpretations. I seek to develop works and perform actions which share a very specific attitude and atmosphere rather than a clearly identifiable style.”        Williams will perform workshops with students in the CU area from October 27-30, 2025. A 2025 review of his recent exhibition “Crossings” can be viewed here:https://hyperallergic.com/1027120/a-moving-encounter-with-the-art-of-bernard-williams/Bernard Williams is an established artist based in Chicago, IL and working in painting, sculpture, installation, and public art. He holds a BFA from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an MFA from Northwestern University. His work has been exhibited in galleries and museums across the U.S., and has been represented by the N’Namdi Gallery in Detroit, the Thomas McCormick Gallery in Chicago, and the Ethan Cohen Gallery in New York. The artist began painting outdoor murals in the early 1990’s with the Chicago Public Art Group. While continuing with CPAG, Williams has added outdoor sculpture to his practice. In recent years he has created several outdoor steel sculptures in Chicago, and completed the Black Tractor Project at the Arts Club of Chicago 2019. In November 2020-May 2021, he debuted a large sculptural work in the “Long Dream” group exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. In 2021 the artist has won two significant outdoor Commissions: The Naomi Anderson installation for Michigan City, Indiana, and in 2023 a large steel sculpture will be installed at Nate Manilow Sculpture Park at Governors State University in University Park, IL.",

A concept that hasn’t existed in the world for even a millennium and yet has been part of a foundational system of capitalism, and many other global advancements for centuries. “BLXCK Uncanny: Tales of the Black + the Weird” is an exhibition in response to the times we are in. The X marking the unknown. As we are accelerating toward technologically advanced futures, we are regressing toward pasts that are not so distant as many of us would like to pretend and unfortunately many of us would like to speed toward. Featuring the work of Oriana Crutcher, Elias Finkelman, Patrick Earl Hammie, and Black Kirby",

Her comics often utilize supernatural elements to explore grief, rage, and profound tenderness.

Currently, Stephens self-publishes her adult graphic novel Darlin' And Her Other Names online. The werewolf-western-horror-romance story depicts two strangers' vengeful journey through Colorado and Kansas in 1881. The first installment of Darlin' And Her Other Names won the 2023 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Artist. Olivia has also won a Fellowship Award from Artist Trust and attended residencies at Tin House, Mineral School, Storyknife, MacDowell, and Yaddo.

        "description": "Speaker: Yueying WuTitle: Harrow, Montanaro: Testing product states, quantum Merlin-Arthur games and tensor Optimisation Abstract: We give a test that can distinguish efficiently between product states of n quantum systems and states which are far from product. If applied to a state psi whose maximum overlap with a product state is 1-epsilon, the test passes with probability 1-Theta(epsilon), regardless of n or the local dimensions of the individual systems. The test uses two copies of psi. We prove correctness of this test as a special case of a more general result regarding stability of maximum output purity of the depolarising channel. A key application of the test is to quantum Merlin-Arthur games with multiple Merlins, where we obtain several structural results that had been previously conjectured, including the fact that efficient soundness amplification is possible and that two Merlins can simulate many Merlins: QMA(k)=QMA(2) for k>=2. Building on a previous result of Aaronson et al, this implies that there is an efficient quantum algorithm to verify 3-SAT with constant soundness, given two unentangled proofs of O(sqrt(n) polylog(n)) qubits. We also show how QMA(2) with log-sized proofs is equivalent to a large number of problems, some related to quantum information (such as testing separability of mixed states) as well as problems without any apparent connection to quantum mechanics (such as computing injective tensor norms of 3-index tensors). As a consequence, we obtain many hardness-of-approximation results, as well as potential algorithmic applications of methods for approximating QMA(2) acceptance probabilities. Finally, our test can also be used to construct an efficient test for determining whether a unitary operator is a tensor product, which is a generalisation of classical linearity testing.

This is a great time to learn and practice earthquake safety with millions of people worldwide.In an earthquake, you may only have seconds to protect yourself before strong shaking knocks you down, or something falls on you. When the adrenaline kicks in, you may not act safely if you haven’t practiced the Drop, Cover, and Hold On drill before that moment. Know what to do when the shaking starts—register for the Great Central US Shakeout https://www.shakeout.org/centralus/ and use the many resources for the drill and preparedness for schools, businesses, government agencies, families, and others.The drill will highlight the “Drop, Cover, and Hold On” protocol:DROP to the ground (before the earthquake drops you!),Take COVER by getting under a sturdy desk or table, andHOLD ON to it until the shaking stops. If there isn’t a table or desk near you, drop to the ground in an inside corner of the building and cover your head and neck with your hands and arms. Do not try to run to another room just to get under a table.You never know when you may use this knowledge anywhere in the world during your travels or future home locations.Everyone can participate! Individuals, families, businesses, schools, government agencies, and organizations are all invited to join in on October 16 at 10:16 a.m. local time.",

This talk considers how the public denial of regret and other \"bad feelings\"—though used to defend trans people—is ineffective in an authoritarian political context. I show how this strategy can demand an unwavering sense of happiness, enlisting trans people to police our own emotions and greatly limiting the affective scope of trans life. I draw from reproductive and disabilty justice as models that intentionally hold space for regret, grief, and ambivalence, even under significant political pressure to reject them. At its heart, this talk argues that embracing such feelings, rather than denying them, can better counter authoritarian efforts to constrain and diminish trans life.",

        "description": "This symposium will explore artistic production, practices, and the agency of printed media before 1750 as they intersect with themes of sexuality and gender.Conceptions of sexuality and gender underwent profound changes in Europe during the premodern era (roughly 1300–1750) and were an important avenue of exploration for printmakers. In art prints, broadsheets, fashion plates, and anatomies alike, human subjects were fashioned and viewed in conversation with cultural attitudes and beliefs about gender and sexuality. Canonical works such as Albrecht Dürer’s \"Adam and Eve\" and Henrick Goltzius’s \"Farnese Hercules as Seen from Behind\" not only convey notions of artistic excellence but also their ideas about idealized bodies, gender roles, and sexuality. Additionally, gender and sexuality had profound effects on artistic practices and training. In a time when many women were precluded from traditional apprenticeships and professional guilds, printmaking could present alternative paths to collaboration and network building. Moreover, as an artform linked with the broad circulation of knowledge but also with intimate, private viewing, prints open doors to consider how artists and beholders conceived of their own experiences of gender and sexuality in and outside of social norms.This symposium focused on sexuality and gender is being held in conjunction with Imagination, Faith, and Desire: Art and Agency in European Prints, 1475–1800, curated by Maureen Warren, Curator of European and American Art, and on view at Krannert Art Museum from Sep 25, 2025–Feb 28, 2026.The event will be hybrid, blending in-person presentations with online presentations via Zoom to make the event more equitable and permit international participation and will also include a walk-through of the exhibition.The keynote speaker will be Dr. Nicole Cook, Senior Program Manager at the Center for Netherlandish Art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

Although widely promoted in online, clinical, and parent communities, these approaches raise substantive concerns that require critical examination. This presentation highlights the importance of neurodiversity-affirming care and situates the NLA/GLP debate within broader questions of evidence-based practice. We begin by noting areas of common ground between advocates and critics, including shared commitments to supporting autistic voices and fostering communicative growth. At the same time, we identify points of contention raised by researchers and practitioners who have rigorously challenged NLA’s strongest claims. Specifically, we outline definitional, conceptual, and empirical problems that continue to undermine NLA’s theoretical and clinical validity. Ultimately, the talk calls for a shift toward neurodiversity-affirming practice grounded in robust evidence. We argue for flexible, responsive approaches that foreground autistic children’s communicative strengths rather than obscuring them, and that move beyond prescriptive models toward more collaborative and context-sensitive supports.",

        "description": "MiV Seminar:  Arvind Ramanathan, Argonne National Lab - \"Autonomous Laboratory for Accelerating Biotherapeutic Discovery\"Abstract:We discuss the implementation of an autonomous laboratory that tightly integrates high performance computing (HPC), robotic platforms and generative artificial intelligence (AI) models for targeting intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDPs represent a significant challenge in targeting for therapeutics due to their expansive conformational flexibility and their functional diversity across cancer signaling pathways. Hence, designing therapeutics that target IDPs based on specific cancer signaling pathways can be challenging -- including the need to capture its conformational plasticity, context of post-translational modifications and signaling specificity with respect to its binding partners. To address these challenges, we build on a molecular- and pathway-scale reasoning system, which allows us to discover known/novel interactions based on existing literature and experimental data. We integrate automated platforms and high throughput experimental techniques to probe IDP-mediated interactions while simultaneously instantiating multi scale molecular simulations to capture molecular mechanisms that govern these interactions using agentic systems. We then combine generative models to suggest novel biologic designs (governed by protein scaffolds such as affitin, affibody, or antibody) that are also tested within the experimental loop. This approach lets us obtain precise control over IDP-mediated signaling within cancer signaling pathways.Bio:Arvind Ramanathan is a staff scientist at Argonne national Laboratory leading efforts in building robotic platforms for exploring complex biological systems.

Structured with the urgency of a thriller, the film weaves together audio recordings, vérité observation, first-person video clips, and an assembled case file—an “archive of her own”—to reveal the black boxes and blind spots in Japan’s judicial and social systems. Her practice bridges investigative reporting with the craft of cinema—mobilizing archival research, counter-forensic methods, and sustained fieldwork to turn personal evidence-gathering into pressingly needed public testimony. Premiering at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival and now released worldwide, the film has been nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA, received a Peabody Award, and garnered more than twenty international prizes, with screenings in over fifty countries.The film run time is 102 minutes.About the Filmmaker:Shiori Itō is an Oscar and BAFTA nominated documentary filmmaker, journalist, writer, and co-founder of Hanashi Films, focusing on gender-based human rights issues. Named one of TIME magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in 2020, her voice continues to resonate globally through film, writing, and public speaking.

        "description": "Abstract: This talk will discuss the recent progress in describing the thermodynamics of quantum trajectories. The problem will be motivated with a discussion of cooling down a superconducting qubit using an absorption refrigerator. We provide an overview of how to use the toolbox of quantum instruments to provide an extremely general formulation of the problem. And we specialize it to the important case of quantum jumps. In both cases, we introduce the basic ideas behind full counting statistics, which is used to connect quantum dynamics to experimental measurement outcomes. Finally, we introduce the notion of stochastic excursions, and how it can be used to understand different mechanisms that contribute to current fluctuations. These concepts will be illustrated with examples from superconducting qubits, transport across quantum dots and atomic masers. Bio: Professor Landi is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Rochester, and an editor for Physical Review Research. Previously he was an assistant professor in Brazil, first at UFABC (2013-2016) then at the University of São Paulo (2016-2022). Professor Landi heads the Quantum Thermodynamics and Quantum Transport group (QT2), which does theory research at the boundary between quantum information sciences and statistical physics. He is a specialist in the field of open quantum systems, with applications to quantum thermodynamics, quantum transport and quantum metrology. His group has contributed extensively to the reformulation of the laws of thermodynamics in the presence of quantum coherence, as well as to the understanding of continuously measured quantum systems, and the connection between classical data and the underlying quantum dynamics.  To watch online, go to the IQUIST YouTube channel:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzAySwQXF8J4kRolUzg2ww",

        "description": "After $K(1)$-localization, the classical $J$-homomorphism can be interpreted as a profinite transfer map. More precisely, it is a transfer map $\\Sigma^{-1}KO^\\wedge_2 \\to \\mathbb{S}_{K(1)}$ from the $C_2$-homotopy fixed points (with a twist) to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2^\\times$-homotopy fixed points of the $2$-complete complex topological $K$-theory. In joint work in progress with Guchuan Li, we extend this idea to define and study profinite transfers between homotopy fixed points of the Morava $E$-theory by closed subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group. We introduce two definitions of the profinite transfer maps. The first defines them as duals to the profinite restriction maps in the appropriate category. At large primes, we show that the image of the transfer map $\\Sigma^{-n^2}E_n \\to \\mathbb{S}_{K(n)}$ on homotopy groups is the $n^2$-th filtration in the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence. A second definition is based on the 6-functor formalism for smooth representations of $p$-adic Lie groups after Heyer--Mann. We prove that the two definitions of profinite transfers are equivalent for homotopy fixed points of the Morava $E$-theory.",

        "description": "High-energy heavy-ion collisions provide a unique environment to study the quark–gluon plasma (QGP) through modifications of jet production. In a deconfined medium, scattering amplitudes are subtly altered, leaving measurable imprints on jet observables. Comparing these modifications with perturbative QCD predictions offers critical insight into the properties of the QGP. In this talk, I will review the theoretical framework for jet modification in a deconfined plasma, emphasizing an all-order perturbative treatment of jet observables. I will also highlight recent developments in our understanding of jet–medium interactions and their phenomenological implications. Finally, I will discuss how these advances inform the precision of jet quenching studies and provide a foundation for future improvements in Monte Carlo event generators",

        "description": "Novel Approaches to Addressing Fuel-Cladding Chemical Interactions for Fast Reactors Abstract: About 19% of electricity produced in the United States comes from nuclear sources. In order to meet the burgeoning demand for electricity, more nuclear reactors must be built, existing reactor lifetime extended, and some shut-down reactors brought back online. Advanced reactors will need to operate under much more severe conditions including higher temperatures, higher radiation doses and more extreme corrosive environments than the current reactors. New materials need to be developed, or existing materials be tailored, for high performance. In the first part of my talk, I will briefly describe my background and expertise, and our department programs at the University of Idaho. In the second part of the talk, I will highlight an array of research activities focused on fast reactor fuel development for managing fuel-cladding chemical interactions (FCCI). Lanthanide fission products (e.g. neodymium, cerium, praseodymium and lanthanum) produced within the fuels migrate toward the cladding-fuel interface, creating intermetallic compounds and leading to the risk of cladding breach. We have demonstrated that detrimental lanthanides can be arrested within the metallic fuel matrix by forming stable intermetallic compounds with externally added dopants such as arsenic and tellurium. An integrated theoretical and experimental approach to screening dopants will be presented for effective capture of lanthanides within the U-Zr fuel matrix. Results from some recent research will also be discussed regarding an alternative approach of countering FCCI via nanostructuring of fuels. Bio: Professor Indrajit Charit has been serving as the Chair in the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Industrial Management at the University of Idaho (UofI), Idaho Falls, since January 2021. He earned his Ph.D. degree in Metallurgical Engineering from Missouri University of Science & Technology (formerly, University of Missouri-Rolla) in 2004. He joined the UofI faculty in 2007 following a postdoctoral stint at the North Carolina State University. His research interests span across various aspects of materials processing, microstructure and materials characterization with a focus on nuclear materials. His research has mainly been supported by different entities including the US Department of Energy – Office of Nuclear Energy, Idaho National Laboratory, National Energy Technology Laboratory, and Idaho funding agencies. He is the author or co-author of about 150 publications including journal articles, conference proceedings, book chapters, and two textbooks. He also serves as a reviewer for various journals and research grant agencies. He is a licensed professional engineer.",

We demonstrate efficient, low-noise, and bidirectional QFC between the telecom (1550 nm) and visible (780 nm) bands using unpoled InGaP (χ²) nanophotonic waveguides, achieving record-low pump power and high loss-inclusive conversion efficiency without relying on long-wavelength pumps. Leveraging the same InGaP platform, we further realize magnetic-free optical nonreciprocity—including isolation and circulation—at the single-photon level through noiseless all-optical frequency conversion on a photonic chip. Both demonstrations preserve quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons, marking significant advances in integrated nonlinear photonics and toward programmable, directional, and scalable quantum networks. Bio: Jierui Hu is a 2nd year ECE graduate student in Kejie Fang’s group researching integrated quantum photonics.",

        "description": "Waves of fear:  oscillatory control of emotional memory Abstract: Memory retrieval requires the coordination of a distributed network of brain structures, including the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.  Coordination of neural activity across distributed brain networks is mediated by local field potentials (LFPs).  During the retrieval of emotional memories, which are relevant to clinical disorders of fear and anxiety, theta power peaks at distinct frequencies during high (3 – 6 Hz) and low (6 – 9 Hz) fear states.  We have recently discovered that the nucleus reuniens, a thalamic hub interconnecting the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, coordinates coherent oscillations in this network.  Moreover, exogenous optogenetic pacing of nucleus reuniens activity imposes coherent activity in the prefrontal-hippocampal network and modulates emotional learning and memory processes.  Closed-loop neural interfaces to regulate oscillatory states in this network may be a promising intervention for fear- and anxiety disorders. Biography: Stephen Maren is director of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and professor of psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he joined the faculty in 2024. Maren’s research seeks to understand the neural basis of anxiety disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. He earned his B.S. at Illinois and his M.S. and Ph.D. at the University of Southern California. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, Los Angeles. He's held tenured faculty positions at the University of Michigan and Texas A&M University.",

        "description": "Abstract: The US electrical grid is experiencing a rapid transition as cheap renewable electricity transforms the energy mix. With these grid changes, new supply is not spatially matched to demand, and the transmission network has become more strained. Better market integration could thus lower US generation costs. This talk will present results from two projects, estimating (1) the excess generation costs associated with transmission congestion and other spatial constraints; and (2) how generator profitability would change if spatial constraints were eliminated. We document that eliminating interregional constraints could reduce generation costs by billions of dollars each year, but would create winners and losers among generation companies. The latter are especially of interest because generators have a large say in whether transmission projects are developed. Biography: Dr. Catie Hausman is an Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Her work focuses on environmental and energy economics. Recent projects have looked at electricity transmission policy; the natural gas sector's role in methane leaks; the economic damages from climate change; and inequality in pollution exposure. Prior to her graduate studies, Dr. Hausman studied in Peru under a Fulbright grant. She has taught Statistics, a policy seminar on Energy and the Environment, and a course on Government Regulation of Industry and the Environment. She holds a BA from the University of Minnesota and a PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of California, Berkeley.",

Motivated by Kitaev’s conjecture, I will detail a concrete construction of a topological space B consisting of translation invariant injective matrix product states (MPS) of all physical and bond dimensions, which plays the role Kitaev’s space in dimension d = 1. Having such a space is a useful tool in the discussion of parametrized phases of MPS; in fact it allows us to define a parametrized phase as a homotopy class of maps into B. The space B is constructed as the quotient of a contractible space E of MPS tensors modulo gauge transformations. The projection map from E to B is a quasifibration, from which we can compute the homotopy groups of the classifying space B by a long exact sequence. In particular, B has the weak homotopy type K(Z, 2) x K(Z, 3), shedding light on Kitaev’s conjecture in the context of MPS.Based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14241About: Weekly seminar of the Quantum Working Group, covering topics in quantum information theory and operator algebras.

The worldsheet theory that describes some of these backgrounds is strongly coupled. We use its underlying affine $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry to continue to weak coupling, by varying the level of the current algebra from the small value relevant for black holes and HP solutions to a large value. In this limit, the dynamics can be captured by a solvable effective field theory, closely related to previous work on the non-abelian Thirring model. I will also discuss several interesting properties of the resulting solutions.",

        "description": "Abstract:Virtual reality (VR) and immersive media provide a unique experimental space for testing and extending psychological and communication theories. In this talk, I’ll walk through how immersive environments have been used to study human experience—not only as platforms for message delivery, but as media with their own psychological effects. I’ll highlight how the field has evolved from examining message-based influences to exploring how immersion itself shapes cognition, emotion, and behavior. Drawing on recent research, I’ll discuss how VR enables controlled, yet ecologically rich simulations that help us observe human responses in ways that traditional media cannot.Mike Yao:Mike Yao is Professor and Director of the Institute of Communications Research at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. His research bridges communication, behavioral science, and human–technology interaction. He leads interdisciplinary projects exploring how immersive and intelligent media shape human experience, with a particular focus on VR as a platform for studying perception, emotion, and social behavior.This event will be presented hybrid, refreshments are provided.Link for Virtual Attendees: https://go.illinois.edu/immerseseminar102325",

She writes essays and books that explore how Native people are represented in popular culture, as well as the impacts of settler colonialism on her family. She is the creator and author of the blog Native Appropriations, the co-creator of the All My Relations Podcast, and the author of Notable Native People: 50 Indigenous Leaders, Dreamers, and Changemakers from Past and Present. In her visual arts practice, she uses traditional Cherokee art forms like basketry, beadwork, and twining with contemporary and found materials, using non-traditional, recycled materials, LED lights, and electroluminescent wire. Her visual work is about reclamation and restoration of cultural practices and identity while weaving an Indigenous future that holds the contradictions and joys of who she is as an Indigenous person. Prior to her time as a Tulsa Artist Fellow, Adrienne was an Assistant Professor of American Studies and Ethnic Studies at Brown University, teaching courses in Indigenous studies and education",

The writing group provides structured writing, break, and discussion time, with each meeting consisting of a short goal-setting conversation, quiet writing time, and a concluding reflection and wrap-up. You will be working on your own current writing (e.g., thesis, dissertation, manuscript). These groups do not offer feedback--if you're looking to learn more and improve your writing, check out our events or make an appointment to get individualized feedback. These groups are ideal for graduate students who are seeking to create or return to a writing routine, make progress and meet deadlines on long-term projects, or jump-start a new writing project. Find more information and our Writing Group FAQs here, and learn more about our consultations and policies.Our writing groups are held every Friday from 9:00am-12:00pm, and we encourage you to attend regularly. We will not meet on campus holidays.This event will be held in a hybrid format: Join us in-person in the Main Library Orange Room. Or, join us online.

        "description": "Despite hundreds of searches, no clear evidence of beyond standard model particles have been found at the LHC so far. However, there still remains a huge landscape of possible signals hiding in LHC data, which is very difficult to fully cover with traditional strategies. Recently, a new class of ‘anomaly detection’ techniques have been developed which aim to cover as much of this landscape as possible so that potential discoveries are not missed. These techniques leverage novel data-driven AI methods to minimize the trade-off between sensitivity and model independence. In this talk, I will present results from the first application of anomaly detection in CMS : a search for resonances decaying to two jets with 'anomalous' substructure. I will also discuss future prospects for these exciting new AI techniques more broadly, and how they may play a key role in a future, robust LHC search program.",

While many of the physically interesting combinations of temperature and density are inaccessible to laboratory experiments on earth, numerical simulations allow us to study the detailed microphysics of these crystals, including how they break, with implications for starquakes, pulsar glitches, and more.",

Thus these “quantum defects”, which can be integrated into solid-state devices, have gained interest as quantum sensors and qubit candidates for scalable quantum networks. In this talk, I will introduce some of the basic quantum defect properties desirable for quantum technologies. I will highlight my own group’s efforts at understanding and controlling the properties of defects in diamond including (1) synthesis, frequency and emission control of deep-level vacancy complexes in diamond and (2) properties of shallow-level donors in ZnO, including single donors and intentionally synthesized donors in ZnO. Bio: Kai-Mei Fu is the Virginia and Prentice Bloedel Professor of Physics and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington and holds a dual appointment with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Kai-Mei received their PhD in Applied Physics in 2007 from Stanford University.

        "description": "Given the direct and indirect effects of physical activity on multiple domains of life, promoting regular opportunities for movement from an early age is considered a vital investment for sustainable societies. However, countries in the Global South, such as Brazil, often face limited capacity and resources to respond to the global call for promoting physical activity. Vulnerable children in Brazil are accumulating less physical activity than the recommended amount during school hours. This Lemann Lecture Series presents results from a call to action focused on unlocking and accelerating physical activity opportunities for low-income children in Arapiraca, Alagoas, Brazil. The project comprised three interconnected studies. The first study, using a cross-sectional design, mapped organizational, political, and cultural factors within four schools and assessed physical activity levels among children (n = 250) during school hours. The second study aimed to develop a school-based physical activity policy through a mixed-methods co-creation process. A two-round Delphi methodology, consisting of an online survey and semi-structured interviews with principals, teachers, administrative staff, and superintendents, was employed to refine the policy and identify perceived barriers and facilitators for its adoption and implementation. The third study was a natural experiment with follow-up measures to evaluate the impact of partial policy adoption in two schools. Results revealed a significant association between school organization and built environment factors, explaining approximately 22% of the variance in children’s physical activity levels. The school-based policy integrates evidence-based guidance with local, context-specific insights to enhance feasibility and relevance. On average, at least 80% of policy items were rated highly in terms of importance, adoption, and implementation by stakeholders. Schools that adopted specific policy components—such as playground renovation and inclusion of a certified Physical Education teacher—showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in children’s physical activity. Future directions include scaling the policy to additional schools, evaluating its long-term impact on children’s physical activity patterns, and strengthening intersectoral collaboration across education, health, and urban planning sectors to ensure sustainable implementation. Rafael Tassitano is an Assistant Professor with 15 years of experience in physical activity epidemiology, focusing on underserved youth populations in Brazil. His research employs mixed methods to identify and implement sustainable physical activity solutions within structured settings.",

Through engaging presentations, the event highlights how biostatistics drives impactful health research and fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration.The conference will be followed by a focused session on quantitative research design, giving attendees an opportunity to explore methodological strategies and enhance their approach to statistical analysis in health research.Schedule:9:00 AM - 9:05 AM Welcome9:05 AM - 9:45 AM Keynote with Dr. Douglas Simpson9:45 AM - 9:50 AM Break9:50 AM - 10:50 AM Panel I speakers: Dr. Annette McCoy,  Dr. Margarita Teran Garcia, Dr. Josie Rudolphi10:50 AM - 10:55 AM Break10:55 AM - 11:55 AM Panel II speakers: Qihao Zhan, Aditya Vaidyam, Maxwell Wallace11:55 AM - Closing remarks12:00 PM - 1:00 PM Break (lunch on your own)1:00 PM - 4:00 PM Quantitative Research Design with Dr. Jesus Sarol, Jr.Speaker information:KeynoteDouglas Simpson and his collaborators use quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to study cervical changes linked to preterm birth. This work shows that QUS can detect risk earlier than standard measures, track how the cervix heals after birth, and be automated for easier use in clinics, bringing QUS closer to becoming a practical tool to help prevent preterm birth.Panel IAnnette McCoy: Clinical research offers both opportunities and challenges for the clinician-scientist. This talk will focus on how study design and managing expectations can overcome factors such as biological variability and small sample size to achieve clinically meaningful outcomes.Margarita Teran Garcia: Obesity is a major concern for Hispanic children, shaped by social and structural barriers to healthy living. A USDA-funded trial, Abriendo Caminos, tested a family-based program across multiple U.S. sites. The program helped prevent short-term weight gain, especially among younger children and girls, but benefits faded after 6 months. Culturally tailored programs can spark short-term changes, though more support is needed to sustain long-term healthy habits.Josie Rudolphi: I will focus on using quantitative methods to describe the mental health status, stress, and safety perceptions of various agricultural populations, how advanced quantitative statistics and interdisciplinary collaborations lead to novel research with agricultural producers and workers, and how our research is informing impactful Extension programs.Panel IIQihao Zhan: Qihao is a fourth-year PhD student in the School of Social Work, studying healthy relationships among adolescents. Her presentation examines adolescent dating experiences using data from the Illinois Youth Survey, focusing on the protective role of school climate in dating violence victimization and its implications for prevention practice.Aditya Vaidyam: Aditya Vaidyam, a medical student and digital psychiatry researcher, co-created the LAMP Platform, an open-source tool that connects patient data from phones and wearables with clinical care. With its AI toolkit Cortex, LAMP enables surveys, mindfulness tools, and personalized interventions, improving access and outcomes—especially for people with serious mental illness.Maxwell Wallace: Max is a visiting research project coordinator working with The Illinois Youth Tobacco Survey (ILYTS), a statewide public health survey designed to track youth tobacco use, exposure, and attitudes among middle and high school students. To be a truly representative survey of Illinois youth, careful methodological practices in sampling, data collection, analysis, and dissemination must be employed to understand this health risk accurately. To assist our team with these complex methods, we partnered with the BERD team to reignite the project after nearly a decade, made possible with funding from the Illinois Department of Public Health.",

        "description": "Everyday chemicals and the uterus: A multiscale multimodal investigation into propylparaben-induced fibrosis Using SHG, AFM, and nanoindentation, we uncover how propylparaben remodels uterine collagen structure and mechanics across scales.Abstract: Parabens are everywhere — in cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals — and are increasingly recognized as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with potential consequences for reproductive health. Among them, propylparaben (PP) has been linked to adverse outcomes, yet its effects on uterine tissue remain largely unknown. In this talk, I will share how we combined optical, mechanical, and nanoscale methods to investigate how chronic PP exposure results in uterine fibrosis. Using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy, we detected heterogeneous increases in the forward-to-backward (F/B) signal ratio and disruption of myometrial collagen organization. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) illustrated nanoscale fibril changes and nanoindentation (NI) linked the collagen remodeling to heterogeneous changes in tissue stiffness. Supported by CZ Biohub Chicago, we are extending this work using novel MRI approaches and inflation testing to investigate PP-induced fibrosis at the tissue scale. Together, these studies show how everyday chemicals alter uterine tissue structure and function, and impact reproductive health.Biography: Amy Wagoner Johnson is a professor of Mechanical Science & Engineering at the Grainger College of Engineering. She is an Andersen Faculty Scholar and a Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago Investigator, and an elected Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and of the American Society for Mechanical Engineering.

        "description": "The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is hosting its monthly colloquium series and invites everyone to participate in the October session. This month's event will be led by William K. M. Lai, Assistant Research Professor in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Computational Biology at Cornell. William directs both the Cornell Center for Vertebrate Genomics and the Cornell EpiGenomics Core Facility. His research group integrates novel genomic assays and custom bioinformatic algorithms, often leveraging machine learning and explainable AI, to dissect how protein-DNA interactions vary across cell states and contribute to disease.Title: Poisoning of networks with adversarial particle swarm optimizationAbstract:We present Adversarial Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) as a black-box optimization-based approach for crafting poisoned data. Poisoned data is a significant threat to the reliability and security of deep learning systems. Unlike prior poisoning methods, APSO leverages swarm intelligence to efficiently search for perturbations that reduce target model performance without any a priori knowledge of training data or access to the model weights and biases. We evaluate APSO on models trained to classify MNIST, CIFAR-10, and AudioMNIST using a variety of architectures and adversarial hardening techniques and demonstrate APSO’s ability to quantify model resilience to adversarial attack. We also investigate the feasibility of black-box transfer attacks wherein attacks performed on one model transfer their poisoning to another. The results highlight a critical concern: the transferability of poisoned data, which poses a potential risk for real-world AI systems, where poisoned data can propagate undetected across diverse models and architectures. These findings underscore the need for enhanced defense mechanisms to safeguard against adversarial threats in multi-model environment.",

The QUG creates a forum for interaction and information sharing in order to facilitate growing the local community of researchers with interest in quantum computing and raise awareness about emerging quantum computing capabilities and for those exploring the use of hybrid classical/quantum computing to share their experiences--both successes and challenges--with others. We encourage researchers with challenging research problems that can potentially benefit from quantum computing along with those who are curious about this to help determine the potential for benefiting your research to participate.  Graduate students and postdocs affiliated with research in classical as well as quantum computing and all campus community members interested in quantum computing are also encouraged to attend.In this first instance of the QUG meeting, we will provide an overview of the intentions of the QUG. This will be complemented with short presentations from Santiago Nunez-Corrales and Wolfgang Pfaff. We will also leave time for open discussion and feedback on these plans and how the QUG can bring the greatest value to the campus community.Also, a quick reminder to sign up for Slack Channel in order to stay up to date on the QUG’s activities.We look forward to seeing you on Oct 30!",

The writing group provides structured writing, break, and discussion time, with each meeting consisting of a short goal-setting conversation, quiet writing time, and a concluding reflection and wrap-up. You will be working on your own current writing (e.g., thesis, dissertation, manuscript). These groups do not offer feedback--if you're looking to learn more and improve your writing, check out our events or make an appointment to get individualized feedback. These groups are ideal for graduate students who are seeking to create or return to a writing routine, make progress and meet deadlines on long-term projects, or jump-start a new writing project. Find more information and our Writing Group FAQs here, and learn more about our consultations and policies.Our writing groups are held every Friday from 9:00am-12:00pm, and we encourage you to attend regularly. We will not meet on campus holidays.This event will be held in a hybrid format: Join us in-person in the Main Library Orange Room. Or, join us online.

        "description": "Inflationary perturbations are fundamentally quantum. In practice, though, it is customary to treat them as classical stochastic fields when computing cosmological observables. This replacement relies on a \"quantum-to-classical\" transition which occurs on superhorizon scales during slow-roll inflation. At the closed-system level, the success of this transition relies on the suppression of the decaying mode (or equivalently, strong squeezing in the Schrödinger picture). Of course, many well-motivated inflationary scenarios deviate from slow roll. In particular, models seeking to enhance small-scale power (e.g. for primordial black hole formation) generically rely on a revival of the decaying mode. Near the transition point where growing and decaying modes exchange dominance, interference effects can become important, potentially invalidating a stochastic description.  Employing the EFT of inflation and working to all orders in perturbation theory, we analyze the dynamics of quantum fluctuations in a background featuring a transient deviation from slow roll. In the far superhorizon limit, we construct the Wigner function W, whose positivity can be used to diagnose the availability of a stochastic description. We find that W becomes highly oscillatory and negative in certain regions of phase space --- a hallmark of quantum interference and non-classicality. Remarkably, these effects persist even upon the return to slow roll, indicating a kind of \"classical-to-quantum\" transition for the affected modes. We conclude that squeezing, or equivalently the size of linear theory growing and decaying modes, is not a reliable indicator of classicality.",

As with so many ancient figures, she is more legend than person today, her story told and retold even as her poetry continues to enchant and move us. Ranging from ancient Greece to seventeenth century France to twentieth century Britain, this exhibit will explore Sappho as poet, muse, and icon.The exhibit, Sweetbitter: The Literary Legacies and Afterlives of Sappho, will be on display in the RBML through May 2025.",

The writing group provides structured writing, break, and discussion time, with each meeting consisting of a short goal-setting conversation, quiet writing time, and a concluding reflection and wrap-up. You will be working on your own current writing (e.g., thesis, dissertation, manuscript). These groups do not offer feedback--if you're looking to learn more and improve your writing, check out our events or make an appointment to get individualized feedback. These groups are ideal for graduate students who are seeking to create or return to a writing routine, make progress and meet deadlines on long-term projects, or jump-start a new writing project. Find more information and our Writing Group FAQs here, and learn more about our consultations and policies.Our writing groups are held every Tuesday from 9:00am-12:00pm, and we encourage you to attend regularly. We will not meet on campus holidays.This event will be held in a hybrid format: Join us in-person in the Main Library Orange Room. Or, join us online. The Zoom link will be in your registration confirmation email and in the weekly reminder emails.The Writers Workshop will email you a weekly reminder.

        "description": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) pose a significant public health challenge in Brazil, as they do in many parts of the world. Research consistently shows that treatment for SUDs tends to be more effective when adapted to the cultural context of the individuals receiving care. However, most evidence-based interventions are developed in North America and subsequently exported to other countries, often without sufficient attention to cultural differences. The process of culturally adapting these interventions is poorly understood and rarely thoroughly documented. This presentation will describe our efforts to culturally adapt and implement a family-based Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention for Brazilian families. Specifically, we focus on families in which one member is affected by a substance use disorder and another family member participates in their treatment sessions. Additionally, we will present our preliminary outcomes from families that received the intervention.  Doug Smith (Ph.D., LCSW) is Professor of Social Work at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  His research focuses on creating and testing substance use interventions.",

Whether you’re discussing calls or decoy spreads, it often requires a lot of trial and error to discover what techniques work best for you, what gear you truly need (and what’s optional), and what waterfowl prefer. If you’re a new waterfowl hunter or want to become one, calling and decoy placement can seem a bit intimidating, which is why this webinar is here for you!We can’t promise you’ll fill your limit or win any calling contests just from watching this webinar, but we do promise to share our best tips and tricks—rooted both in the art from years of waterfowl hunting experience and the science of waterfowl behavior and ecology—to help you start calling in birds and placing decoys confidently. We’ll give you a solid foundation to develop your own techniques and learn more as you go, along with some great resources to help you take the next steps on your waterfowler journey!This session is free, but registration is required.",

        "description": "Advancing Portable Widefield Fundus Cameras for Teleophthalmology and Decentralized Eye CareAbstract: Fundus photography is an indispensable tool for eye disease screening and management. Conventional fundus cameras are limited by restricted field of view, bulky design, and the frequent need for pharmacologic dilation. Our laboratory has pursued innovative strategies to address these limitations and develop portable, widefield retinal imaging technologies, with the goal of enabling affordable and accessible screening, progression monitoring, and post-treatment management in decentralized care settings. By introducing alternative illumination methods, including miniaturized indirect, trans-pars-planar, and trans-palpebral illumination, we have created compact devices capable of capturing widefield (>100°) and ultra-widefield (>200°) retinal and choroidal images without dilation. These innovations have also enabled the development of low-cost, high dynamic range (HDR) fundus cameras and multispectral platforms for depth-resolved chorioretinal imaging. More recently, we have integrated widefield fundus cameras with complementary modalities such as ultrasound, investigated spectral efficiency for AI-assisted disease classification, and demonstrated transcranial illumination for contrast agent-free choroidal imaging. Together, these efforts highlight a translational pipeline from engineering innovation to clinical application, with the aim of making advanced retinal imaging more accessible, affordable, and impactful in teleophthalmology and global eye care.Biography: Xincheng Yao, PhD, is a Professor and the Richard & Loan Hill Endowed Chair in Biomedical Engineering and Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), and a Fellow of SPIE, Optica, and AIMBE. He received his PhD in Optics from the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2001, followed by postdoctoral research in the Biophysics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) from 2001 to 2004. He then served as a Technical Staff Member at LANL (2004–2006) and as a Senior Research Scientist at CFD Research Corporation (2006–2007). In 2007, he joined the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) as a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, received the NSF CAREER Award in 2011, and was promoted to tenured Associate Professor in 2012. In 2014, he joined UIC as Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences, was appointed Richard & Loan Hill Endowed Professor in 2016, named a University Scholar in 2018, and promoted to Richard & Loan Hill Endowed Chair in 2023.

The session will cover program benefits, project selection, and insights and Q&A with Prof. Wendy Rogers and Prof. Catalina Alzate, both affiliates of IHSI, about their experiences as CAS faculty mentors. If you cannot attend the info session, please register to receive a notification when the recording is available.About the Community-Academic Scholars (CAS) ProgramNow in its eight year, the CAS program matches researchers with undergraduate research assistants who receive training, guidance, and a stipend to support their success. Beyond the summer program, researchers are invited to engage with IHSI to continue developing their projects. All Illinois faculty and staff who conduct community-engaged research are encouraged to apply, as the program seeks to address the multiple dimensions, determinants, and expanse of areas that affect human health and well-being. The application period will open Jan. 7, 2026, with applications due Jan. 28, 2026.Community-Academic Scholars have diverse interests and skillsets, and all share a commitment to making an impact in our community. Preference is given to students whose experiences or interests reflect a strong alignment with the population that the project serves and/or the project’s methodologies. Previous mentors have shared that their scholars’ contributions and insights have been invaluable to their research projects, and that these mentoring relationships have also been personally rewarding.For questions, please reach out to Max Wallace at mmw3@illinois.edu.Register for the Nov. 6 info session",

        "description": "Dr. Tanveer Singh joined the Chung lab in April 2024.The Chung laboratory is interested in understanding how ion channels and their dynamic regulation modulate neuronal excitability, communications, and plasticity in the brain.Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that generate electric current by mediating the flow of ions across the plasma membrane in morphologically and functionally distinct neuronal compartments called axons and dendrites. Axons generate and propagate action potentials whereas dendrites receive them at inter-cellular junctions called synapses where synaptic transmissions (communications) occur between neurons.Ion channel dysregulation is involved in a wide variety of neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. In Chung lab, we focus on epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Epilepsy is a common chronic brain disorder caused by excessive brain activity clinically characterized as seizures, which are abnormal and uncontrolled discharges of electrical signals in the brain cells called neurons. Drug-resistant seizures have severe consequences including cognitive decline, high mortality rate, psychiatric disorders, neurodevelopmental delay, and brain damage. Hence, better understanding of the pathogenesis of epilepsy is critical to develop novel therapeutic interventions and early diagnostics for epilepsy. A fundamental question is “how do neurons change themselves to produce excessive electrical signals in an epileptic brain compared to a normal brain?”",

        "description": "Abstract: Fermi surfaces have a number of fascinating properties, including a continuum of gapless excitations, a landscape of possible collective modes, universal super-area law entanglement, and relevant deformations that can produce non-Fermi liquid quantum critical metals. Their extreme gaplessness makes them difficult to tame with the conventional tools of QFT. Bosonization provides a potential nonperturbative approach by describing Fermi surface dynamics through a collective field living on a part of phase space. However, while such a field is sensible semiclassically, the challenge of treating it quantum mechanically has prevented bosonization from providing as powerful a tool as in one dimension. I will show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a particular large N limit of a U(N)_1 WZW model, with a tower of irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom in the collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches.",

        "description": "In fourteenth-century Provence, the volume of contracts produced by scribes known as public notaries increased rapidly from thousands each year to millions. By the fifteenth century, virtually all social and economic relations could be guaranteed by a notarial act. Reliance on the written word expanded both geographically and socially, reaching even the region's most remote rural communities and serving the interests of marginalized actors, including women, peasants, and religious minorities. This talk seeks to answer fundamental questions about this extraordinary moment in late medieval law, literacy, and technology: Why did written records become so wildly popular so quickly? What were the consequences of this rapid legal and cultural transformation? And how did the lives and logics of everyday legal actors change as a result?",

This leads to unmasking of target EHF cues, which could help listeners identify the target talker. Children’s greater sensitivity at EHFs and reliance on greater signal bandwidth could make EHF cues especially useful for children. In this talk I will present preliminary findings from a study where adult and child listeners were tested on their sensitivity to the relative head orientations of talkers in a multi-talker scene.",

        "description": "Please join this two part seminar. All are welcome to stay after the seminar for informal networking with the the center team.MASTERS: Multisensory VR Environments to Train First Responders under Emotional StressThe MASTERS project brings together a transdisciplinary consortium spanning computer science, HCI, mechanics, philosophy, cognitive sciences, and medicine to design innovative training methods for first responders (law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical staff, etc.). Its central goal is to support them in maintaining self-control under high-stress conditions, whether the constraints are psychological, social, or situational.Building on field studies, the project aims to develop a multisensory, immersive, and collaborative VR training program that realistically simulates socio-emotional situations. The presentation will first provide an overview of the project and its methodological approach before turning to the key challenges in designing such environments, including interpersonal haptic interactions, user representations, and interactions with virtual agents, elements that are critical to ensuring realism and training efficiency.Speaker:Amine Chellali received his M.Sc. in Robotics from École Centrale de Nantes (France) in 2005 and his Ph.D. in HCI from the University of Nantes (France) in 2009. From 2009 to 2011, he worked as a research assistant at the IRCCyN Lab. He then moved to the U.S. to work as a postdoctoral associate at Tufts University in the EREL Lab from 2011 to 2012 and then as a research associate in the ISSyL lab at Harvard Medical School. Currently, he is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Evry Paris-Saclay (France) and co-leader of the Interaction, Mixed Reality, and Assistive Robotics (IRA2) research group at the IBISC Lab. His research interests include Simulator fidelity, Haptic interactions, Collaborative virtual environments, and the transfer and evaluation of human skills. The main applications are in the field of medical training. He has received several grants for his research on VR simulation from the French National Research Agency and other national funding sources. Emotion Analysis and Empathic Adaptation in Immersive Scenarios: Toward Ethically Informed Human Understanding and EngagementThis research first explores the use of adaptive immersive scenarios to enhance human understanding and engagement in different contexts. The models combine ontologies, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) to produce stressful scenarios for training first responders. These scenarios are personalized according to each user’s profile, accounting for individual vulnerabilities—such as empathy, sensitivity to authority, or stress triggers—to create ethically informed and effective experiences.Building on this concept of user-centered scenario design, the ITS-STORY project investigates the use of mixed reality to foster historical empathy. Focusing on the Royallieu Camp Memorial in Compiègne, the project examines how immersive technologies can renew public engagement with the history of internment and deportation during the Second World War. Among the projects's objectives is the adaptation of immersive scenarios to participants' empathic responses, enabling personalized and ethically sensitive experiences that foster deeper historical understanding while avoiding exaggerated emotional engagement.Within this framework, the research focuses on the detection and quantification of empathy through facial emotion recognition using computer vision and machine learning. The aim is to understand whether empathic responses—elicited by historically grounded virtual scenarios—can be inferred from emotional cues. Building on multiple iterations of facial emotion recognition models, the work has evolved toward explainable approaches, combining deep learning architectures with SHAP-based interpretability analyses.This presentation addresses the adaptive design of scenarios according to user responses, details the methodological framework for measuring empathy through facial emotion analysis, and discusses ongoing challenges in linking emotional and empathic responses in immersive memorial environments. Together, these initiatives highlight the potential of personalized immersive experiences to enhance both professional training and public engagement and demonstrate how measuring emotional and empathic responses can inform ethically sensitive scenario design.Speakers:Domitile Lourdeaux is Full Professor at the CNRS Heudiasyc UMR 7253 laboratory at the Université de technologie de Compiègne UTC – Alliance Sorbonne University.

However, experimentally testing all relevant combinations of cell types, chemicals, and doses for regulatory purposes is a daunting task. We have developed scVIDR, a deep generative learning-based tool to predict single-cell gene expression perturbations induced by chemical pollutants and drugs. scVIDR is able to accurately predict dose-dependent gene expression changes across cell types in mouse liver, human blood cells, and cancer cell lines. I will also present our work on quantitative analysis of perturbations in spatiotemporal gene expression patterns in the mammalian liver induced under exposure to environmental pollutants and during liver disease.Biography: Dr. Sudin Bhattacharya is an Associate Professor in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Pharmacology & Toxicology, as well as the Institute for Quantitative Health Science and Engineering, at Michigan State University. He leads a lab conducting research at the interface of computation and biology, studying the gene regulatory networks that underline cell fate choice and its perturbation by environmental pollutants. His current work focuses on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis in the context of cell fate choice and tissue architecture. Dr. Bhattacharya earned his undergraduate degree at Jadavpur University, India; his master’s degree at the University of Kentucky; and his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan.",

        "description": "The RBML is thrilled to host Gillen D’Arcy Wood, who will speak about his new book, The Wake of HMS Challenger: How a Legendary Victorian Voyage Tells the Story of Our Oceans' Decline. Copies of the book will be available for purchase and signing. This event is free and open to the public, and refreshments will be served.In December 1872, HMS Challenger embarked on the first round-the-world oceanographic expedition. Its goal: to shine a light for the first time on the mysteries of the deep sea. For the next four years, Challenger’s naturalists explored the oceans, encountering never-before-seen marvels of marine life. The expedition’s achievements are the stuff of legend. It identified major ocean currents and defining features of the seafloor, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Mariana Trench. It measured worldwide sea temperatures and chemistry, creating baseline data for all ocean research since. And, most spectacularly of all, it collected nearly five thousand sea creatures and plants new to science. In The Wake of HMS Challenger, Gillen D’Arcy Wood looks afresh at this legendary scientific odyssey and shows why, 150 years later, its legacy looms larger than ever.The Challenger’s scientists had no way of knowing that the incredible undersea aquarium they were documenting was on the verge of catastrophic change. Off Portugal, they encountered a brilliant starfish now threatened with extinction by microplastics; in St. Thomas, teeming coral habitats that today have been decimated by ocean warming; and at remote Ascension Island, the breeding grounds of the now-endangered green turtle. Lyrical and elegiac, The Wake of HMS Challenger offers a stunning before-and-after picture of our global oceans. It is both a reminder of what we have lost since the Victorian age and an urgent call to preserve what remains of the diverse life and wild beauty of our planet’s final frontier.",

        "description": "This study explores the role of critical thinking in fostering resistance to misinformation and its influence on intentions to verify information and share content on social media. Using a national survey (N=928) in the U.S., the findings indicate that individuals with strong critical thinking skills are more likely to verify information they encounter on social media and less likely to share unverified content. These relationships are mediated by greater perceived threat of misinformation and more positive attitudes toward fact-checking. The results highlight the significance of cultivating critical thinking skills as a key strategy to strengthen public resilience against misinformation. Here is a little bit about Dr. Sang-Hwa Oh:  https://media.illinois.edu/oh-sang-hwa/Feel free to bring a brown bag lunch!",

Dealing with the silences of the archive – the voices and identities written out of history – requires new and innovative tools, and in this talk she surveys the many different approaches she has taken across her fiction and non-fiction writing to recover women: from deep analysis of Greek texts to popular contemporary myth retellings to innovative takes on history that mix fact and fiction to uncover new ways of knowing. Join her on an adventure across time and the tools of history to re-discover the women of the ancient world.Copies of Hauser's recent books Penelope’s Bones: A New History of Homer’s World through the Women Written Out of It and How Women Became Poets: A Gender History of Greek Literature will be available onsite for purchase and signing.

You will be working on your own current writing (e.g., thesis, dissertation, manuscript). These groups do not offer feedback--if you're looking to learn more and improve your writing, check out our events or make an appointment to get individualized feedback. These groups are ideal for graduate students who are seeking to create or return to a writing routine, make progress and meet deadlines on long-term projects, or jump-start a new writing project. Find more information and our Writing Group FAQs here, and learn more about our consultations and policies.Our writing groups are held every Tuesday from 9:00am-12:00pm, and we encourage you to attend regularly. We will not meet on campus holidays.This event will be held in a hybrid format: Join us in-person in the Main Library Orange Room. Or, join us online.

        "description": "Abstract: Quantum computing and sensing represent two distinct frontiers of quantum information science. Here, we harness quantum computing to solve a fundamental and practically important sensing problem: the detection of weak oscillating fields with unknown strength and frequency. We present a quantum computing enhanced sensing protocol, that we dub quantum search sensing, outperforming all existing approaches. Furthermore, we prove our approach is optimal by establishing the Grover-Heisenberg limit -- a fundamental lower bound on the minimum sensing time. The key idea is to robustly digitize the continuous, analog signal into a discrete operation, which is then integrated into a quantumalgorithm. Our metrological gain originates from quantum computation, distinguishing our protocol from conventional sensing approaches. Indeed, we prove that broad classes of protocols based on quantum Fisher information, finite-lifetime quantum memory, or classical signal processing are strictly less powerful. We propose and analyze a proof-of-principle experiment using nitrogen-vacancy centers, where meaningful improvements are achievable using current technology. This work establishes quantum computation as a powerful new resource for advancing sensing capabilities. Bio: Soonwon Choi is a Victor F. Weisskopf Career Development Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT, whose research is focused on quantum information science and technology and its applications for studying out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Choi completed his undergraduate study in physics at Caltech in 2012, got his PhD degree in physics from Harvard University in 2018. Then he worked as a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley before joining MIT as an assistant professor in July 2021.    To watch online, go to the IQUIST YouTube channel:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzAySwQXF8J4kRolUzg2ww",

        "description": "Defects as Foe or Friend: The Development of Silicon Carbide from Nuclear Batteries to Quantum SensorsAbstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is well suited for radiation sensing in harsh environments due to its wide bandgap (3.2 eV for 4H-SiC), strong radiation tolerance, and high-temperature resilience. There are still many untapped research topics in this area: high-temperature applications, fast neutron detection for fission and fusion systems, use as an alternative to silicon for low-energy X-ray detection, SiC avalanche photodiodes for UV light detection, nuclear batteries, and even emerging work in quantum sensing due to its spin defects and potential for lab-on-chip device integration. In this talk, I will present our work on developing SiC for alpha spectroscopy, demonstrating performance up to 500 °C, its application in nuclear batteries, and our initial efforts toward quantum sensors for reactor dose monitoring, as well as future directions for MeV neutron detection. This seminar is also given as an IEEE NPSS Distinguished Lecture. Bio:  Dr. L. Raymond Cao is a Professor and Director of the Nuclear Engineering Program at The Ohio State University (OSU), where he has also served as Director of the OSU Nuclear Reactor Laboratory since 2016. He earned his B.S. in nuclear physics from Lanzhou University in 1994, M.S. in nuclear physics from the China Institute of Atomic Energy in 2002, and his Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2007. Before joining OSU in 2009, Dr. Cao completed postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical School and at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Dr. Cao’s research is at the intersection of applied physics and nuclear engineering, with a focus on radiation detection and sensing technologies. He has published ~ 200 journal and conference papers and holds 30 patents. He currently serves as a Senior Editor for IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science, IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Distinguished Lecturer, and as a member of the editorial board of Nuclear Science and Engineering. Dr. Cao is a member of the Executive Committee of the Isotopes and Radiation Division (IRD) of the American Nuclear Society, where he served as Chair from 2015 to 2016.

The writing group provides structured writing, break, and discussion time, with each meeting consisting of a short goal-setting conversation, quiet writing time, and a concluding reflection and wrap-up. You will be working on your own current writing (e.g., thesis, dissertation, manuscript). These groups do not offer feedback--if you're looking to learn more and improve your writing, check out our events or make an appointment to get individualized feedback. These groups are ideal for graduate students who are seeking to create or return to a writing routine, make progress and meet deadlines on long-term projects, or jump-start a new writing project. Find more information and our Writing Group FAQs here, and learn more about our consultations and policies.Our writing groups are held every Friday from 9:00am-12:00pm, and we encourage you to attend regularly. We will not meet on campus holidays.This event will be held in a hybrid format: Join us in-person in the Main Library Orange Room. Or, join us online.

        "description": "Create the \"write\" habit! Our writing group provides graduate students with dedicated time to make progress on writing in a supportive atmosphere. The writing group provides structured writing, break, and discussion time, with each meeting consisting of a short goal-setting conversation, quiet writing time, and a concluding reflection and wrap-up. You will be working on your own current writing (e.g., thesis, dissertation, manuscript). These groups do not offer feedback--if you're looking to learn more and improve your writing, check out our events or make an appointment to get individualized feedback. These groups are ideal for graduate students who are seeking to create or return to a writing routine, make progress and meet deadlines on long-term projects, or jump-start a new writing project. Find more information and our Writing Group FAQs here, and learn more about our consultations and policies.Our writing groups are held every Tuesday from 9:00am-12:00pm, and we encourage you to attend regularly. We will not meet on campus holidays.This event will be held in a hybrid format: Join us in-person in the Main Library Orange Room. Or, join us online. The Zoom link will be in your registration confirmation email and in the weekly reminder emails.The Writers Workshop will email you a weekly reminder.

        "description": "In this talk I will give a common-sense introduction to the topic of strange metals. First observed in copper oxide high-temperature superconductors, the strange metal state is now seen in a wide variety of materials, ranging from organic molecular crystals to cold atom simulators to twisted bilayer graphene. The key feature is Planckian dissipation, where the scattering rate  is determined only by fundamental constants, representing a conjectured universal bound on the degree of quantum entanglement possible in a many-body system. I will review the history of this strange metals, starting with the marginal Fermi liquid theory of the late 1980’s to the development of the SYK model by Sachdev and Ye in 1993, which Kitaev showed in 2014 could be “derived” using holographic duality via the AdS-CFT correspondence, drawing intriguing parallels to black holes.Additionally, I will present our latest data* on density fluctuations in the strange metal Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, which show the system to be quantum critical and conformally invariant, the latter meaning the system behaves as if the dynamics occur on a circle of radius 1/T in imaginary time. I will provide evidence for an excitation that may be related to Kitaev’s “scramblon,” which he argued is a generic feature of the extreme dissipative nature of the strange metal state.",

        "description": "Join us for a lecture in the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age Speaker Series with John Durham Peters.Considering Forgiveness in a Time of Ubiquitous RecordingThe shift of the basis of public life from slow and centralized print and audiovisual media to faster, ubiquitous, distributed, user-generated short-form word and video material has been widely noted.  I want to ask what the new mode of incessant documentation of raw behavior means for the possibility of both forgiveness and the collective learning process essential to public deliberation.  If every word or deed is frozen in its first draft, what then?  Some consequences are the once ubiquitous genre of the “statement” as apparently trustworthy speech, the recoding of common knowledge as corrosive secrets whose exposure is worried to have damaging effects, and an obsessive public hermeneutics of small nonverbal gestures at the expense of speech.  Is a reformist or redemptive rethink of this communication infrastructure possible or are we stuck?  What are the morally distorting effects of omnipresent surveillance?  This talk might not answer that question, but it will tease it in many ways.    About the SpeakerJohn Durham Peters is the María Rosa Menocal Professor of English and Professor of Film and Media Studies at Yale University. He teaches and writes on media history and theory. He taught at the University of Iowa between 1986-2016. He is the author of Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication (1999), Courting the Abyss: Free Speech and the Liberal Tradition (2005), The Marvelous Clouds: Toward a Philosophy of Elemental Media (2015), and most recently, Promiscuous Knowledge: Information, Image, and Other Truth Games in History (2020), with the late Kenneth Cmiel.

This talk considers how the public denial of regret and other \"bad feelings\"—though used to defend trans people—is ineffective in an authoritarian political context. I show how this strategy can demand an unwavering sense of happiness, enlisting trans people to police our own emotions and greatly limiting the affective scope of trans life. I draw from reproductive and disabilty justice as models that intentionally hold space for regret, grief, and ambivalence, even under significant political pressure to reject them. At its heart, this talk argues that embracing such feelings, rather than denying them, can better counter authoritarian efforts to constrain and diminish trans life.",

        "description": "Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss two entropic puzzles in JT gravity and their resolution, which requires taking into account non-perturbative effects in the gravitational path integral. In JT gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the gravitational thermal entropy becomes negative at very low temperatures. This puzzle arises when computing the annealed (instead of quenched) entropy, corresponding to an incorrect averaging procedure in the dual matrix model. After defining an “intermediate” quantity, the semi-quenched entropy, I will explain how the positivity of entropy can be rescued. From the bulk perspective, both a resummation of higher-genus topologies and wormhole effects are crucial. From the matrix model perspective, the resolution relies on the statistics of eigenvalues near the edge, governed, in different regimes, by the Airy distribution or by 1-eigenvalue instantons. A related puzzle arises where the entanglement entropy across a two-sided black hole can become negative when inserting a large number of matter excitations behind the black hole horizon. First posed by Lin, Maldacena, Rosenberg, and Shan in two-sided BPS black holes in SUSY JT gravity, I will show this paradox extends to non-SUSY JT gravity with matter as well and demonstrate how positivity is rescued in both cases. Finally, I will discuss a tensor network toy model with the same features.",

        "description": "This symposium will explore artistic production, practices, and the agency of printed media before 1750 as they intersect with themes of sexuality and gender.Conceptions of sexuality and gender underwent profound changes in Europe during the premodern era (roughly 1300–1750) and were an important avenue of exploration for printmakers. In art prints, broadsheets, fashion plates, and anatomies alike, human subjects were fashioned and viewed in conversation with cultural attitudes and beliefs about gender and sexuality. Canonical works such as Albrecht Dürer’s \"Adam and Eve\" and Henrick Goltzius’s \"Farnese Hercules as Seen from Behind\" not only convey notions of artistic excellence but also their ideas about idealized bodies, gender roles, and sexuality. Additionally, gender and sexuality had profound effects on artistic practices and training. In a time when many women were precluded from traditional apprenticeships and professional guilds, printmaking could present alternative paths to collaboration and network building. Moreover, as an artform linked with the broad circulation of knowledge but also with intimate, private viewing, prints open doors to consider how artists and beholders conceived of their own experiences of gender and sexuality in and outside of social norms.This symposium focused on sexuality and gender is being held in conjunction with Imagination, Faith, and Desire: Art and Agency in European Prints, 1475–1800, curated by Maureen Warren, Curator of European and American Art, and on view at Krannert Art Museum from Sep 25, 2025–Feb 28, 2026.The event will be hybrid, blending in-person presentations with online presentations via Zoom to make the event more equitable and permit international participation and will also include a walk-through of the exhibition.The keynote speaker will be Dr. Nicole Cook, Senior Program Manager at the Center for Netherlandish Art at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

        "description": "Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language generation, yet their propensity to \"hallucinate\"—generating non-factual or unfaithful content—remains a critical challenge to their reliable deployment. This talk presents a research journey aimed at building more truthful AI, charting a course from granular detection to proactive mitigation. We begin with a detailed exploration of hallucination detection in the news domain. We present a framework for identifying hallucinations in generated news headlines. This work is extended through a fine-grained, multilingual typology of hallucinations, providing a more nuanced understanding of how models fail across different languages. Building on these diagnostic insights, we then shift to a new training-time hallucination mitigation framework. Specifically, we look at how search-augmented multi-step reinforcement learning can post-train LLMs for improved internal factual consistency. Finally, the talk concludes by outlining some interesting future research directions for building fundamentally more reliable generative systems.Bio: Jiaming Shen is a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind, specializing in natural language processing, data mining, and machine learning. His research focuses on assisting humans with LLM agents for knowledge acquisition, decision making, and creative thinking. His research has been acknowledged through several awards, including the ACL Outstanding Paper Honorable Mention in 2023, the Yunni & Maxine Pao Memorial Fellowship in 2019, and the Brian Totty Graduate Fellowship in 2016.

Although widely promoted in online, clinical, and parent communities, these approaches raise substantive concerns that require critical examination. This presentation highlights the importance of neurodiversity-affirming care and situates the NLA/GLP debate within broader questions of evidence-based practice. We begin by noting areas of common ground between advocates and critics, including shared commitments to supporting autistic voices and fostering communicative growth. At the same time, we identify points of contention raised by researchers and practitioners who have rigorously challenged NLA’s strongest claims. Specifically, we outline definitional, conceptual, and empirical problems that continue to undermine NLA’s theoretical and clinical validity. Ultimately, the talk calls for a shift toward neurodiversity-affirming practice grounded in robust evidence. We argue for flexible, responsive approaches that foreground autistic children’s communicative strengths rather than obscuring them, and that move beyond prescriptive models toward more collaborative and context-sensitive supports.",

        "description": "Electron microscopy and atomic-scale characterization are undergoing a revolution fueled by the new capabilities of electron ptychography, which is setting records for spatial resolution down to 20 picometers.  In this talk, I will discuss how my group is developing atomically precise methods to characterize materials using electron ptychography, and the new science we are accessing using these new capabilities. These projects span from using ptychography to visualize thermal vibrations atom-by-atom, to recovering 3D atomic coordinates of 2D moiré materials from a single projection. In addition, we are making cutting-edge techniques of advanced electron microscopy more accessible by using ptychography to achieve 0.44 angstrom spatial resolution in a conventional scanning transmission electron microscope, nearly quadrupling its intrinsic optical resolution. This work demonstrates that expensive aberration correctors are no longer required to achieve atom-by-atom imaging, a significant step towards democratizing access to high-end electron microscopy.",

        "description": "MiV Seminar:  Arvind Ramanathan, Argonne National Lab - \"Autonomous Laboratory for Accelerating Biotherapeutic Discovery\"Abstract:We discuss the implementation of an autonomous laboratory that tightly integrates high performance computing (HPC), robotic platforms and generative artificial intelligence (AI) models for targeting intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDPs represent a significant challenge in targeting for therapeutics due to their expansive conformational flexibility and their functional diversity across cancer signaling pathways. Hence, designing therapeutics that target IDPs based on specific cancer signaling pathways can be challenging -- including the need to capture its conformational plasticity, context of post-translational modifications and signaling specificity with respect to its binding partners. To address these challenges, we build on a molecular- and pathway-scale reasoning system, which allows us to discover known/novel interactions based on existing literature and experimental data. We integrate automated platforms and high throughput experimental techniques to probe IDP-mediated interactions while simultaneously instantiating multi scale molecular simulations to capture molecular mechanisms that govern these interactions using agentic systems. We then combine generative models to suggest novel biologic designs (governed by protein scaffolds such as affitin, affibody, or antibody) that are also tested within the experimental loop. This approach lets us obtain precise control over IDP-mediated signaling within cancer signaling pathways.Bio:Arvind Ramanathan is a staff scientist at Argonne national Laboratory leading efforts in building robotic platforms for exploring complex biological systems.

Originally born in Tokyo, she is now a Cultural Ambassador for the Fukushima Tourism Exchange. She is active as a traveling calligrapher, embarking on journeys such as the ‘Calligraphy Tour of All 59 Municipalities in Fukushima Prefecture’ and the ‘Japanese Calligraphy Journey.’ Since 2013, she has been conducting large-scale calligraphy demonstrations and workshops at overseas educational institutions. In 2020, she provided calligraphy for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic commemorative monument, and in 2024, she won the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Award at the 2024 National Open Calligraphy Exhibition.Shinya Terasawa is a washi paper craftsman based in the Kamikawasaki Washi (Traditional Japanese Paper) Folklore Museum. The Kamikawasaki area of Nihonmatsu City is a production area of handmade washi paper with a history of about 1,000 years, and this facility was built in 2001 with the aim of passing on and preserving Kamikawasaki washi paper. He operates the workshop within the museum where visitors can observe the washi paper-making process and experience making washi paper. In 2021, he launched a project called Washito, dedicated to the promotion of Kamikawasaki washi.Masaji Hashimoto is an 18th generation artisan of Hashimoto Hiroji Mingei located in Takashiba Craft Village in Koriyama City, Fukushima. Takashiba Craft Village has 300 years of history of hariko. Many artisans continue to handcraft hariko dolls there, and visitors can observe the production process up close. He is also a successor of the Hyottoko Odori, one of the dances along with Shichifukujin Odori, designated as Important Intangible Folk Cultural Properties of Koriyama City.Hirohisa Saito is a printmaker and aizome (Japanese indigo dyeing) artist with nearly 40 years of experience in the field. He graduated from Nihon University College of Art in 1981 and completed additional studies at Nihon University College of Art's Art Research Institute in 1983. In 1985, he established Saito Graphic Arts. Saito spent two years in Los Angeles from 1989 as an Overseas Research Fellow for the Agency for Cultural Affairs to study screen printing. His works have been featured in solo exhibitions at various galleries and received various awards. As an educator, he is a part-time lecturer at Koriyama Women's University and a part-time lecturer at Tokyo University of the Arts. He is a Member of the Saitama Prefecture Art Association, Vice President of the Saitama Prefecture Printmakers’ Association, and Auditor of the Fukushima Watercolor Painting Association.Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts. Arts and crafts include disciplines such as ceramics, textiles, woodworking, lacquerware, papermaking, and other means of artistic expression that involve considerable understanding of traditional methods and techniques. Artisans hone their skills to create objects that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Kogei artists and their produced objects are valued for their rich history that reflect intangible cultural heritage spanning hundreds of years, as techniques and processes are passed down from generation to generation. A category of kogei is mingei, (民芸), which translates to “folk crafts,” and is formed from minshu (民衆), meaning common people, and kogei (工芸). Art critic and philosopher Soetsu Yanagi created this term and the mingei movement in the 1920/30s to distinguish the value of everyday items made for ordinary use for the common person.The Kogei exhibition and programming are supported by the Japan Foundation New York through the U.S.-Japan Community Grassroots Exchange Program. Japan House is proud to highlight the traditional arts and crafts of Fukushima and feature the stories of Fukushima. Japan House acknowledges support from the Illinois Arts Council for this program. In addition, Chiba is a George A. Miller Visiting Artist supported by the Center for Advanced Study at the University of Illinois.FAQsWhat are my transport/parking options getting to the event?Japan House is located in the Arboretum at the University of Illinois at 2000 S.

        "description": "Japan House is pleased to host an washi (Japanese paper) workshop featuring Fukushima artist Shinya Terasawa as part of the Kogei: Traditional Arts and Crafts project. Guests will learn about the washi craft process and history, then they can learn to make a postcard from pulp to take home!From the late 17th century during the Edo period, Fukushima Prefecture, like many other regions of Japan, actively protected and promoted industries to increase cash income. One of the major industries at that time was handmade washi production, particularly Kamikawasaki Washi, which continues today as a traditional craft. The Kamikawasaki district of Nihonmatsu City, Fukushima Prefecture, was the largest producer of washi in the region, especially shōji paper (paper used for traditional sliding doors). The craftsmanship of Kamikawasaki Washi has been recognized as a Fukushima Prefecture-designated Important Intangible Cultural Property (craft technique). Today, it is carefully preserved and passed down by the local community, with the Washi Denshokan (Traditional Paper Heritage Museum) in Nihonmatsu City serving as a central hub for its preservation.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop. Guests will be provided with all supplies but are asked to wear clothing that they don't mind getting wet.*Please feel free to bring a small leaf or flattened flower that you would like to embed in your postcard. :)________Shinya Terasawa is a washi paper craftsman based in the Kamikawasaki Washi (Traditional Japanese Paper) Folklore Museum. The Kamikawasaki area of Nihonmatsu City is a production area of handmade washi paper with a history of about 1,000 years, and this facility was built in 2001 with the aim of passing on and preserving Kamikawasaki washi paper. He operates the workshop within the museum where visitors such as tourists and students can observe the washi paper-making process and experience making washi paper. In 2021, he launched a project called Washito, dedicated to the promotion of Kamikawasaki washi.________Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts. Arts and crafts include disciplines such as ceramics, textiles, woodworking, lacquerware, papermaking, and other means of artistic expression that involve considerable understanding of traditional methods and techniques. Artisans hone their skills to create objects that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Kogei artists and their produced objects are valued for their rich history that reflect intangible cultural heritage spanning hundreds of years, as techniques and processes are passed down from generation to generation. A category of kogei is mingei, (民芸), which translates to “folk crafts,” and is formed from minshu (民衆), meaning common people, and kogei (工芸). Art critic and philosopher Soetsu Yanagi created this term and the mingei movement in the 1920/30s to distinguish the value of everyday items made for ordinary use for the common person.The Kogei exhibition and programming are supported by the Japan Foundation New York through the U.S.-Japan Community Grassroots Exchange Program. Japan House is proud to highlight the traditional arts and crafts of Fukushima and feature the stories of Fukushima. This program is also partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council through federal funds provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.",

Structured with the urgency of a thriller, the film weaves together audio recordings, vérité observation, first-person video clips, and an assembled case file—an “archive of her own”—to reveal the black boxes and blind spots in Japan’s judicial and social systems. Her practice bridges investigative reporting with the craft of cinema—mobilizing archival research, counter-forensic methods, and sustained fieldwork to turn personal evidence-gathering into pressingly needed public testimony. Premiering at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival and now released worldwide, the film has been nominated for an Academy Award and a BAFTA, received a Peabody Award, and garnered more than twenty international prizes, with screenings in over fifty countries.The film run time is 102 minutes.About the Filmmaker:Shiori Itō is an Oscar and BAFTA nominated documentary filmmaker, journalist, writer, and co-founder of Hanashi Films, focusing on gender-based human rights issues.

        "description": "Abstract: This talk will discuss the recent progress in describing the thermodynamics of quantum trajectories. The problem will be motivated with a discussion of cooling down a superconducting qubit using an absorption refrigerator. We provide an overview of how to use the toolbox of quantum instruments to provide an extremely general formulation of the problem. And we specialize it to the important case of quantum jumps. In both cases, we introduce the basic ideas behind full counting statistics, which is used to connect quantum dynamics to experimental measurement outcomes. Finally, we introduce the notion of stochastic excursions, and how it can be used to understand different mechanisms that contribute to current fluctuations. These concepts will be illustrated with examples from superconducting qubits, transport across quantum dots and atomic masers. Bio: Professor Landi is an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Rochester, and an editor for Physical Review Research. Previously he was an assistant professor in Brazil, first at UFABC (2013-2016) then at the University of São Paulo (2016-2022). Professor Landi heads the Quantum Thermodynamics and Quantum Transport group (QT2), which does theory research at the boundary between quantum information sciences and statistical physics. He is a specialist in the field of open quantum systems, with applications to quantum thermodynamics, quantum transport and quantum metrology. His group has contributed extensively to the reformulation of the laws of thermodynamics in the presence of quantum coherence, as well as to the understanding of continuously measured quantum systems, and the connection between classical data and the underlying quantum dynamics.  To watch online, go to the IQUIST YouTube channel:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzAySwQXF8J4kRolUzg2ww",

        "description": "After $K(1)$-localization, the classical $J$-homomorphism can be interpreted as a profinite transfer map. More precisely, it is a transfer map $\\Sigma^{-1}KO^\\wedge_2 \\to \\mathbb{S}_{K(1)}$ from the $C_2$-homotopy fixed points (with a twist) to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2^\\times$-homotopy fixed points of the $2$-complete complex topological $K$-theory. In joint work in progress with Guchuan Li, we extend this idea to define and study profinite transfers between homotopy fixed points of the Morava $E$-theory by closed subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group. We introduce two definitions of the profinite transfer maps. The first defines them as duals to the profinite restriction maps in the appropriate category. At large primes, we show that the image of the transfer map $\\Sigma^{-n^2}E_n \\to \\mathbb{S}_{K(n)}$ on homotopy groups is the $n^2$-th filtration in the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence. A second definition is based on the 6-functor formalism for smooth representations of $p$-adic Lie groups after Heyer--Mann. We prove that the two definitions of profinite transfers are equivalent for homotopy fixed points of the Morava $E$-theory.",

The interaction laws between these particles can be explicitly determined, hence we can infer the existence of equilibria i.e., bound states in this extreme regime, and their properties.

        "description": "Supermassive black hole binaries are thought to be an inevitable product of the prevailing galaxy evolution scenarios where most massive galaxies host a central black hole and undergo mergers over cosmic time. The early stages of this process have been observed in the form of interacting galaxy pairs and widely separated dual quasars, but the close, gravitationally bound binaries that are expected to follow have proven elusive. The detection of this population is important because at the smallest separations they become bright sources of low-frequency gravitational waves and are prime targets for multi-messenger detections with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this talk, I will discuss observational signatures of close binary supermassive black holes, especially in the context of regular quasar variability, and ongoing work towards multi-messenger detections with telescopes and gravitational wave detectors.",

        "description": "Novel Approaches to Addressing Fuel-Cladding Chemical Interactions for Fast Reactors Abstract: About 19% of electricity produced in the United States comes from nuclear sources. In order to meet the burgeoning demand for electricity, more nuclear reactors must be built, existing reactor lifetime extended, and some shut-down reactors brought back online. Advanced reactors will need to operate under much more severe conditions including higher temperatures, higher radiation doses and more extreme corrosive environments than the current reactors. New materials need to be developed, or existing materials be tailored, for high performance. In the first part of my talk, I will briefly describe my background and expertise, and our department programs at the University of Idaho. In the second part of the talk, I will highlight an array of research activities focused on fast reactor fuel development for managing fuel-cladding chemical interactions (FCCI). Lanthanide fission products (e.g. neodymium, cerium, praseodymium and lanthanum) produced within the fuels migrate toward the cladding-fuel interface, creating intermetallic compounds and leading to the risk of cladding breach. We have demonstrated that detrimental lanthanides can be arrested within the metallic fuel matrix by forming stable intermetallic compounds with externally added dopants such as arsenic and tellurium. An integrated theoretical and experimental approach to screening dopants will be presented for effective capture of lanthanides within the U-Zr fuel matrix. Results from some recent research will also be discussed regarding an alternative approach of countering FCCI via nanostructuring of fuels. Bio: Professor Indrajit Charit has been serving as the Chair in the Department of Nuclear Engineering and Industrial Management at the University of Idaho (UofI), Idaho Falls, since January 2021.

        "description": "Onsetting the multi-messenger era with gravitational wave sources, the GW170817 event proved to be fundamental in addressing many open questions related to binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, demonstrating in particular that such physical systems can power short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). To understand the mechanisms behind the production of the corresponding relativistic jets, it is crucial to consistently model, via numerical simulations, the different phases involved, i.e. inspiral, merger, jet production, break-out, and further jet propagation. In this talk, I will present the first set of jet-launching BNS merger simulations performed with our general relativistic (GR) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code 'Spritz'. Focusing on the delayed-collapse scenario, in which the remnant neutron star survives for ≈25–50 ms after merger, for the first time we self-consistently capture two sequential outflows powered by distinct central engines—a pre-collapse remnant NS-collimated outflow and a post-collapse BH–disk jet—and their interaction. Next, I will introduce the procedure we developed to hand-off the outcome of BNS merger simulations into the special relativistic MHD code 'PLUTO' and show how the application of such a procedure to our jet-launching model allows us to consistently follow further jet evolution on much larger temporal and spatial scales. Finally, I will briefly introduce our new GPU-accelerated GRMHD code 'AsterX', aimed at high-resolution BNS merger simulations over larger  temporal and spatial scales, with the goal of achieving predictive, end-to-end modelling of SGRB central engines.",

        "description": "Abstract: The US electrical grid is experiencing a rapid transition as cheap renewable electricity transforms the energy mix. With these grid changes, new supply is not spatially matched to demand, and the transmission network has become more strained. Better market integration could thus lower US generation costs. This talk will present results from two projects, estimating (1) the excess generation costs associated with transmission congestion and other spatial constraints; and (2) how generator profitability would change if spatial constraints were eliminated. We document that eliminating interregional constraints could reduce generation costs by billions of dollars each year, but would create winners and losers among generation companies. The latter are especially of interest because generators have a large say in whether transmission projects are developed. Biography: Dr. Catie Hausman is an Associate Professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Her work focuses on environmental and energy economics. Recent projects have looked at electricity transmission policy; the natural gas sector's role in methane leaks; the economic damages from climate change; and inequality in pollution exposure. Prior to her graduate studies, Dr. Hausman studied in Peru under a Fulbright grant. She has taught Statistics, a policy seminar on Energy and the Environment, and a course on Government Regulation of Industry and the Environment.

However, understanding diverse, ambiguous language commands is challenging. Grounding language to structured task specifications enables autonomous robots to understand a broad range of natural language and solve long-horizon tasks with safety guarantees. Linear temporal logic (LTL) provides unambiguous semantics for language grounding, and its compositionality can induce skill transfer.In this talk, I will first propose two language grounding systems. 1) Lang2LTL is a modular system that uses large language models (LLMs) to ground navigation commands with diverse temporal patterns to LTL task specifications in novel environments without retraining. 2) Improved upon its predecessor, Lang2LTL-2 uses LLMs and a pretrained vision-language model to ground spatiotemporal navigation commands. By translating language to LTL, both systems can detect infeasible task specifications and abort execution when necessary. 3) Next, I will introduce LTL-Transfer, a zero-shot transfer algorithm that leverages the compositionality of LTL to reuse learned skills to solve novel tasks without violating any safety constraints. In future work, I want to develop robotic systems that produce robust and verifiable behavior by integrating multimodal grounding and human-robot dialogue.Relevant Papers:https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11649https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10802696https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05096https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13245 Bio:Jason Xinyu Liu is a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, working with Prof. Julie Shah.

        "description": "Talk synopsis: When we look back to the early days of computing, user and device were distant, often located in separate rooms. Then, in the ’70s, personal computers “moved in” with users. In the ’90s, mobile devices moved computing into users’ pockets. Recently, wearables brought computing into constant physical contact with the user’s skin. These transitions proved useful: moving closer to users allowed interactive devices to sense more of their usersand act more personal. The main question that drives my research is: what is the next interface paradigm that supersedes wearable devices?I propose that the next generation of interfaces will be defined by how devices integrate with the user’s biological senses and actuators. For the past years, my lab has been exploring how this body-device integration allows to engineer interactive devices that intentionally borrow parts of the body for input and output, rather than adding more technology to the body. The first key advantage of body-device integration is that puts forward a new generation of miniaturized devices; allowing us to circumvent traditional physical constraints. For instance, in the case of our devices based on electrical muscle stimulation, they illustrate how to create realistic haptic feedback (e.g., forces in VR/AR) while circumventing the constraints imposed by robotic exoskeletons, which need to balance their output power against the size of their motors and batteries. Taking this further, we successfully applied this body-device integration approach to other sensory modalities. For instance, we engineered a device that delivers chemicals to the user to render temperature sensations without the need to rely on cumbersome thermal actuators. Our approach to miniaturizing devices is especially useful to advance mobile interactions, such as in virtual or augmented reality, where users have a desire to remain untethered.A second key advantage is that integrating devices with the user’s body allows for new interactions to emerge without encumbering the user’s hands. Using our approach, we demonstrated how to create tactile sensations in the user’s fingerpads without putting any hardware on the fingerpads—instead, we intercept the fingerpad nerves from the back of the user’s hand. This allows users to benefit from haptic feedback (e.g., tactile cues they can use asguidance in VR/AR) without detriment to their dexterity. Taking this further, we also demonstrated that by using brain stimulation we can achieve haptic feedback on all four limbs without wearing any hardware (e.g., feeling forces & tactile sensations on both hands and feet)—opening up a new way to achieve haptics by directly stimulation the source (brain) rather than the endpoints (limbs).A third facet is that our integrated devices enable new physical modes of reasoning with computers, going beyond just symbolic thinking. For example, we have engineered a set of devices that control the user’s muscles to provide tacit information to the user, such as a muscle-stimulation device to learn new skills (piano or signlanguage), or our wearable devices to allow users to control information using their bodies and without the need for screens (e.g., using their lips, hands or feet for both input and output). A fourth key aspect that we found while integrating devices with the user’s body is that we can endow users withnew physical abilities. Examples include a device that allows users to locate odor sources by “smelling in stereo” as well as a device that physically accelerates one’s reaction time using muscle stimulation, which can steer users to safety or even catch a falling object that they would normally miss. While this integration between humans and computers is beneficial (e.g., faster reaction time, realistic simulations in VR/AR, or faster skill acquisition), it also requires tackling new challenges, such as improving the precision of how we safely stimulate the body or the question of agency: do we feel in control when our body is integrated with an interface? Together with our colleagues in neuroscience, we have been measuring how our brain encodes agency to improve the design of this new type of computer interface. We found that, even in the extreme case of our interfaces that electrically control the user’s muscles, it is possible to improve the user’s sense of agency. More importantly, we found that it is only by preserving the user’s sense of agency that these integrated devices provide benefits even after the user takes them out. Finally, I believe that these bodily-integrated devices are the natural succession to wearable interfaces and allow us to investigate how interfaces will connect to our bodies in a more direct and personal way.Bio:  Pedro Lopes is an Associate Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Pedro focuses on integrating interfaces with the human body—exploring the interface paradigm that supersedes wearables. Examples of these new interfaces include muscle stimulation wearables that allow users to manipulate tools they have never seen before or that accelerate reaction time, or a device that leverages the smell to create an illusion of temperature. These interactive devices augment the body, not just cognitively, but physically (e.g., Pedro’s wearable that accelerates a person’s reaction time made it to the Guinness Book of World Records). Importantly, these devices allow to explore a unique form of Embodied-AI, where the assistance happens not textually but directly in the user’s body: imagining learning a new task not by watching a video or asking ChatGPT, but by having a system activate your own body to perform the task (e.g., using muscle stimulation or exoskeletons)—our empirical evidence finds that this new form of embodied-learning can even outperform traditional skill-acquisition. Recently, Pedro is also exploring how computer interfaces can provide assistance and promote attitude change with regards to critical societal challenges, such as reducing electronic waste (computationally-drivenrecycling). Pedro’s work has received several academic awards, such as seven CHI/UIST Best Papers, seven CHI/UIST Honorable Mentions, Sloan Fellowship, NSF CAREER award, IEEE VR Significant New Researcher Award, and captured the interest of the public (e.g., New York Times, Wired, New Scientist, exhibited at Science Gallery, Ars Electronica, etc.).

        "description": "Abstract: Condensed matter physics seeks to understand the collective behavior of particles, which often manifest as quasiparticles. The principle of fractionalization, in particular, uncovers exotic particles with no Standard Model counterpart, such as anyons. A seminal example is the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), where electrons in a 2D gas form quasiparticles with fractional charge and anyonic statistics under an extreme magnetic field and low temperature. However, these stringent experimental conditions pose significant challenges for manipulating and probing these exotic states.This talk will present the discovery and recent advances in the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE), a lattice analog of the FQHE that emerges in the topological flat bands of twisted MoTe₂ at zero magnetic field and at possibly elevated temperatures using combined optical spectroscopy and transport measurement. The less stringent experimental conditions enable the application of novel experimental probes previously incompatible/hard with FQHE systems. We will focus on recent progress using these new techniques, including the possible detection of charge-neutral spin excitations with novel device design, which could provide new insights into the nature of anyonic physics in this strongly correlated platform.",

        "description": "GenAI has contributed to significant confusion in higher education as to its appropriate or ethical uses, implications for academic integrity, and the responsibility for developing AI literacy. As universities develop AI strategies, responsibilities are often delegated to individual instructors and units in ways that support academic freedom and creativity, but lead to extraordinary diversity of practices. As a result, students are faced with challenges quite distinct from other facets of academic integrity, as they generally must reconcile conflicting expectations across courses without general educational support to develop core AI literacy competencies. In this talk, Dr. Madelyn Rose Sanfilippo will discuss how her research critically evaluating and comparing university AI policies has informed her own policies and practices in the classroom, as well as the need for greater normative consensus and institutional coordination.This hybrid presentation will take place on Thursday, October 23 at 10 am in CITL’s Innovation Studio (Armory 172) and on Zoom.

We use its underlying affine $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry to continue to weak coupling, by varying the level of the current algebra from the small value relevant for black holes and HP solutions to a large value.

        "description": "Speaker: Adharsh KamathTitle: Pattern Matching in AI Compilers and Its FormalizationAbstract: PyPM is a Python-based domain specific language (DSL) for building rewrite-based optimization passes on machine learning computation graphs. Users define individual optimizations by writing (a) patterns that match subgraphs of a computation graph and (b) corresponding rules which replace a matched subgraph with an optimized kernel. PyPM is distinguished from the many other DSLs for defining rewriting passes by its complex and novel pattern language which borrows concepts from logic programming. PyPM patterns can be recursive, nondeterminstic, and can require checking domain-specific constraints such as the shapes of tensors. The PyPM implementation is thus similarly complicated, consisting of thousands of lines of C++ code. In this paper, we present our work on building PyPM, as well as formalizing and distilling and this complexity to an understandable mathematical core. We have developed a formal core calculus expressing the main operations of the PyPM pattern language. We define both a declarative semantics – describing which patterns match which terms – and an algorithmic semantics – an idealized version of the PyPM pattern interpreter – and prove their equivalence. The development is fully mechanized in the Coq proof assistant.Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) 2025_______________________________________________________________________________________________Speaker: Jai AroraTitle: Polyjuice: Detecting Mis-compilation Bugs in Tensor Compilers with Equality Saturation Based RewritingAbstract: Tensor compilers are essential for deploying deep learning applications across various hardware platforms. While powerful, they are inherently complex and present significant challenges in ensuring correctness. This paper introduces PolyJuice, an automatic detection tool for identifying mis-compilation bugs in tensor compilers. Its basic idea is to construct semantically-equivalent computation graphs to validate the correctness of tensor compilers. The main challenge is to construct equivalent graphs capable of efficiently exploring the diverse optimization logic during compilation. We approach it from two dimensions. First, we propose arithmetic and structural equivalent rewrite rules to modify the dataflow of a tensor program. Second, we design an efficient equality saturation based rewriting framework to identify the most simplified and the most complex equivalent computation graphs for an input graph. After that, the outcome computation graphs have different dataflow and will likely experience different optimization processes during compilation. We applied it to five well-tested industrial tensor compilers, namely PyTorch Inductor, OnnxRuntime, TVM, TensorRT, and XLA, as well as two well-maintained academic tensor compilers, EinNet and Hidet. In total, PolyJuice detected 84 non-crash mis-compilation bugs, out of which 49 were confirmed with 20 fixed.Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages 2024",

        "description": "\"A Yellow Spot on the Silver Screen”—Anna May Wong’s Performative PleasureJoin us in person or via Zoom for this Fall’s Roger Ebert Lecture, given by Yiman Wang, professor of film and digital media at UC Santa Cruz. Wang’s lecture will present from her recent book To Be an Actress, on early Hollywood Chinese-American performer Anna May Wong and her work in cinema, theater, radio, and American television. Anna May Wong forged a four-decade media-crossing, border-crossing career largely during the U.S. segregation era. Her recent return to public attention testifies to her indelible legacy. Yet, how we might reanimate her legacy remains a question. Viewing Wong as a performer and worker, not just a star, Wang invites a reconsideration of racialized, gendered, and migratory labor as the bedrock of the entertainment industries.  Yiman Wang is Professor of Film & Digital Media at University of California, Santa Cruz. She is author of Remaking Chinese Cinema: Through the Prism of Shanghai, Hong Kong and Hollywood (University of Hawaii Press 2013), and To Be an Actress: Labor and Performance in Anna May Wong’s Cross-Media World (University of California Press 2024). She has published numerous articles in journals and edited volumes on topics of feminist media histories, ethnic border-crossing stardom, eco-cinema and environmental media, Chinese cinema, independent documentary, film remakes and adaptation. She is editor of a special issue of Feminist Media Histories on Asian Feminist Media (2019), co-editor of an InFocus Dossier on Queering Asian Media in Journal of Cinema and Media Studies (2023), co-editor of Chinese Animation: Multiplicities in Motion (2025), and co-editor of the Global East Asian Screen Cultures book series published by Bloomsbury. This event is free and open to the public. Presented by the Roger Ebert Center for Film Studies and co-sponsored by the Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies and the Asian American Cultural Center.Note: As part of the Roger Ebert Lecture, be sure to watch the Ebert Lecture Screening of Piccadilly (1929) held the night before the lecture, on Thursday, Oct. 23, at 7 p.m. at Spurlock Museum.",

        "description": "Japan House is pleased to host an aizome (indigo dyeing) workshop featuring Fukushima artist Hirohisa Saito as part of the Kogei: Traditional Arts and Crafts project. Guests will learn about the aizome craft process and history, then they can learn to stencil dye a Japanese paper fan to take home!Aizome is a traditional dyeing technique that uses indigo plants to color fabrics a deep blue (indigo) hue. In Fukushima Prefecture, indigo production thrived in areas such as Aizubange Town and Minamiaizu Town, reaching its peak during the Meiji era (around 1900). Even today, traditional indigo dyeing techniques are preserved in Minamiaizu and other parts of the region. One notable example of Aizome’s cultural significance is its connection to local festivals. The Tajima Gion Festival, held in Minamiaizu, features traditional men's attire (asa-kamishimo, hemp ceremonial robes) dyed using locally produced indigo by skilled artisans. This highlights the deep ties between indigo dyeing and regional traditions. Additionally, stencil dyeing techniques using katagami (dye paper stencils) were widely practiced, allowing artisans to create intricate fabric patterns. In the Aizu region of Fukushima Prefecture, a unique style of stencil known as Aizugata was developed and produced from the Edo period to the early Showa era. Today, Aizugata remains a cherished design, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern aesthetics.Reservations are required, no walk-ins or observers will be allowed due to limited space inside and the hands-on nature of the workshop. Guests will be provided with all supplies but are asked to wear clothing that they don't mind getting ink on.________Hirohisa Saito is a printmaker and aizome (Japanese indigo dyeing) artist with nearly 40 years of experience in the field. He graduated from Nihon University College of Art in 1981 and completed additional studies at Nihon University College of Art's Art Research Institute in 1983. In 1985, he established Saito Graphic Arts. Saito spent two years in Los Angeles from 1989 as an Overseas Research Fellow for the Agency for Cultural Affairs to study screen printing. His works have been featured in solo exhibitions at various galleries and received various awards. As an educator, he is a part-time lecturer at Koriyama Women's University and a part-time lecturer at Tokyo University of the Arts. He is a Member of the Saitama Prefecture Art Association, Vice President of the Saitama Prefecture Printmakers’ Association, and Auditor of the Fukushima Watercolor Painting Association.________Kogei (工芸) translates to traditional arts and crafts. Arts and crafts include disciplines such as ceramics, textiles, woodworking, lacquerware, papermaking, and other means of artistic expression that involve considerable understanding of traditional methods and techniques. Artisans hone their skills to create objects that are both practical and aesthetically pleasing. Kogei artists and their produced objects are valued for their rich history that reflect intangible cultural heritage spanning hundreds of years, as techniques and processes are passed down from generation to generation. A category of kogei is mingei, (民芸), which translates to “folk crafts,” and is formed from minshu (民衆), meaning common people, and kogei (工芸). Art critic and philosopher Soetsu Yanagi created this term and the mingei movement in the 1920/30s to distinguish the value of everyday items made for ordinary use for the common person.The Kogei exhibition and programming are supported by the Japan Foundation New York through the U.S.-Japan Community Grassroots Exchange Program. Japan House is proud to highlight the traditional arts and crafts of Fukushima and feature the stories of Fukushima. This program is also partially supported by a grant from the Illinois Arts Council through federal funds provided by the National Endowment for the Arts.",

Thus these “quantum defects”, which can be integrated into solid-state devices, have gained interest as quantum sensors and qubit candidates for scalable quantum networks. In this talk, I will introduce some of the basic quantum defect properties desirable for quantum technologies. I will highlight my own group’s efforts at understanding and controlling the properties of defects in diamond including (1) synthesis, frequency and emission control of deep-level vacancy complexes in diamond and (2) properties of shallow-level donors in ZnO, including single donors and intentionally synthesized donors in ZnO. Bio: Kai-Mei Fu is the Virginia and Prentice Bloedel Professor of Physics and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington and holds a dual appointment with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Kai-Mei received their PhD in Applied Physics in 2007 from Stanford University.

        "description": "Given the direct and indirect effects of physical activity on multiple domains of life, promoting regular opportunities for movement from an early age is considered a vital investment for sustainable societies. However, countries in the Global South, such as Brazil, often face limited capacity and resources to respond to the global call for promoting physical activity. Vulnerable children in Brazil are accumulating less physical activity than the recommended amount during school hours. This Lemann Lecture Series presents results from a call to action focused on unlocking and accelerating physical activity opportunities for low-income children in Arapiraca, Alagoas, Brazil. The project comprised three interconnected studies. The first study, using a cross-sectional design, mapped organizational, political, and cultural factors within four schools and assessed physical activity levels among children (n = 250) during school hours. The second study aimed to develop a school-based physical activity policy through a mixed-methods co-creation process. A two-round Delphi methodology, consisting of an online survey and semi-structured interviews with principals, teachers, administrative staff, and superintendents, was employed to refine the policy and identify perceived barriers and facilitators for its adoption and implementation. The third study was a natural experiment with follow-up measures to evaluate the impact of partial policy adoption in two schools. Results revealed a significant association between school organization and built environment factors, explaining approximately 22% of the variance in children’s physical activity levels. The school-based policy integrates evidence-based guidance with local, context-specific insights to enhance feasibility and relevance. On average, at least 80% of policy items were rated highly in terms of importance, adoption, and implementation by stakeholders. Schools that adopted specific policy components—such as playground renovation and inclusion of a certified Physical Education teacher—showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in children’s physical activity. Future directions include scaling the policy to additional schools, evaluating its long-term impact on children’s physical activity patterns, and strengthening intersectoral collaboration across education, health, and urban planning sectors to ensure sustainable implementation. Rafael Tassitano is an Assistant Professor with 15 years of experience in physical activity epidemiology, focusing on underserved youth populations in Brazil. His research employs mixed methods to identify and implement sustainable physical activity solutions within structured settings.",

In an overcrowded immigrant camp, a shy young man happens upon a beautiful girl, Saida, singing by the river. In the midst of chaos and uncertainty, they fall in love.

        "description": "The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is hosting its monthly colloquium series and invites everyone to participate in the October session. This month's event will be led by William K. M. Lai, Assistant Research Professor in Molecular Biology, Genetics, and Computational Biology at Cornell. William directs both the Cornell Center for Vertebrate Genomics and the Cornell EpiGenomics Core Facility. His research group integrates novel genomic assays and custom bioinformatic algorithms, often leveraging machine learning and explainable AI, to dissect how protein-DNA interactions vary across cell states and contribute to disease.Title: Poisoning of networks with adversarial particle swarm optimizationAbstract:We present Adversarial Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) as a black-box optimization-based approach for crafting poisoned data. Poisoned data is a significant threat to the reliability and security of deep learning systems. Unlike prior poisoning methods, APSO leverages swarm intelligence to efficiently search for perturbations that reduce target model performance without any a priori knowledge of training data or access to the model weights and biases. We evaluate APSO on models trained to classify MNIST, CIFAR-10, and AudioMNIST using a variety of architectures and adversarial hardening techniques and demonstrate APSO’s ability to quantify model resilience to adversarial attack. We also investigate the feasibility of black-box transfer attacks wherein attacks performed on one model transfer their poisoning to another. The results highlight a critical concern: the transferability of poisoned data, which poses a potential risk for real-world AI systems, where poisoned data can propagate undetected across diverse models and architectures. These findings underscore the need for enhanced defense mechanisms to safeguard against adversarial threats in multi-model environment.",

The QUG creates a forum for interaction and information sharing in order to facilitate growing the local community of researchers with interest in quantum computing and raise awareness about emerging quantum computing capabilities and for those exploring the use of hybrid classical/quantum computing to share their experiences--both successes and challenges--with others. We encourage researchers with challenging research problems that can potentially benefit from quantum computing along with those who are curious about this to help determine the potential for benefiting your research to participate.  Graduate students and postdocs affiliated with research in classical as well as quantum computing and all campus community members interested in quantum computing are also encouraged to attend.In this first instance of the QUG meeting, we will provide an overview of the intentions of the QUG. This will be complemented with short presentations from Santiago Nunez-Corrales and Wolfgang Pfaff. We will also leave time for open discussion and feedback on these plans and how the QUG can bring the greatest value to the campus community.Also, a quick reminder to sign up for Slack Channel in order to stay up to date on the QUG’s activities.We look forward to seeing you on Oct 30!",

While scholars know of the Soviet Union’s successful outreach in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, Russia’s current relations with the Global South have received less attention. We explore both the contemporary and historical influences shaping Russia’s network of multilateral alliances.  These alliances span the globe and include pockets of support in Europe and the United States. Our research has significance for American foreign policy, scholarship, and university curricula.Choi Chatterjee is the co-director of the Urban Ecology Center and an Emerita Professor of History at California State University, Los Angeles.

        "description": "Breaking the Assessment Bottleneck: Finding Human-AI Balance in Feedback at Scale. At-scale programs face a dilemma: how to maintain educational quality and a great experience while keeping programs affordable and sustainable. This presentation demonstrates how AI-assisted grading (where AI helps graders focus their time on students needing more assistance) can resolve this tension through three experiments at the Gies College of Business, showing how institutions can deliver quality education at scale without unsustainable cost increases.Traditional at-scale programs face critical trade-offs: hiring additional graders increases costs, while instructional team burnout and delayed or limited feedback compromise student experience. These constraints encourage reliance on multiple-choice or team assignments that reduce grading costs but limit learning outcomes. Our experiments show how AI-assisted grading breaks this cycle, enabling meaningful individual assessments at scale without proportional cost increases.We'll share research findings on student perceptions, results from full deployment in at-scale courses, and outcomes from AI-generated customized feedback. The talk includes demonstrating the Sense AI grading platform, showing how technology supports human graders in analyzing student work and providing feedback at-scale with appropriate oversight.Attendees will explore ethical considerations and implementation strategies, gaining actionable insights for using AI to make at-scale programs more affordable while improving educational quality.This hybrid presentation will take place on Monday, November 3 at 10 am in CITL’s Innovation Studio (Armory 172) and on Zoom.

        "description": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) pose a significant public health challenge in Brazil, as they do in many parts of the world. Research consistently shows that treatment for SUDs tends to be more effective when adapted to the cultural context of the individuals receiving care. However, most evidence-based interventions are developed in North America and subsequently exported to other countries, often without sufficient attention to cultural differences. The process of culturally adapting these interventions is poorly understood and rarely thoroughly documented. This presentation will describe our efforts to culturally adapt and implement a family-based Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention for Brazilian families. Specifically, we focus on families in which one member is affected by a substance use disorder and another family member participates in their treatment sessions. Additionally, we will present our preliminary outcomes from families that received the intervention.  Doug Smith (Ph.D., LCSW) is Professor of Social Work at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  His research focuses on creating and testing substance use interventions.",

        "description": "Abstract: The Bose–Hubbard model is a cornerstone of quantum many-body physics, capturing the interplay between kinetic energy and interactions in lattice boson systems. In equilibrium, effective field-theoretical approaches highlight the role of Berry-phase–like terms and reveal the nature of collective excitations across the superfluid–Mott transition. I will first review these equilibrium insights. I will then turn to discuss a minimal Bose–Hubbard model under a chiral drive implemented by light carrying finite orbital angular momentum. This Floquet-type drive introduces a new control knob — chirality — that qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram. Strikingly, the system evolves toward non-trivial driven-dissipative steady states that exhibit quantum-chaotic dynamics. Together, these two threads bridge insights from equilibrium field theory with the physics of Floquet-driven steady states, giving insights into the structure of the collective excitations and showing how light can be used to engineer, destabilize, and ultimately control complex quantum phases. Experimental platforms ranging from cold atoms to polariton condensates and superconducting circuits offer promising routes for realizing these ideas.This seminar will take place at noon in room ESB 3110Zoom Link: https://illinois.zoom.us/my/icmt.seminar?pwd=ZU1KbnBLeXZLUmJKc0oyU205cDNDdz09Meeting ID: 791 382 8328Password: 106237",

In this talk, I will present data from multiple field studies to argue that these struggles can stem from mismatches in how scientists and administrators conceptualize the nature of collaborative work. I will show how, in practice, successful collaborations depend upon intricate communicative labor performed by a constellation of professionals, but organizational policies and investments often undermine this labor. I will then share data from an interdisciplinary institute whose policies and resources incentivized collaborative labor. Comparing qualitative accounts of worker experiences alongside multiple analyses of communication network structures at this institute, I show how acknowledging collaborative work can shape the landscape of collaboration to facilitate interdisciplinarity success. We will close with a discussion of how acknowledging collaborative work can inform team science in terms of professional development opportunities, acknowledging the important role of staff and administrative expertise, and motivating specific science policies and resources.Register to attend hereAbout William C. BarleyWilliam C. Barley is an associate professor of communication at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His research examines the labor involved in building and maintaining cross-boundary relationships in diverse scientific and technical contexts, including natural science teams, weather modeling, large-scale scientific computing, automobile engineering,  and children’s hospital emergency rooms.",

Her comics often utilize supernatural elements to explore grief, rage, and profound tenderness. She is the author of Artie and the Wolf Moon, a middle-grade graphic novel about a young teen discovering her family's werewolf legacy, her own power, and the threats that come along with it. Currently, Stephens self-publishes her adult graphic novel Darlin' And Her Other Names online. The werewolf-western-horror-romance story depicts two strangers' vengeful journey through Colorado and Kansas in 1881. The first installment of Darlin' And Her Other Names won the 2023 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Artist. Olivia has also won a Fellowship Award from Artist Trust and attended residencies at Tin House, Mineral School, Storyknife, MacDowell, and Yaddo.

        "description": "Dr. Tanveer Singh joined the Chung lab in April 2024.The Chung laboratory is interested in understanding how ion channels and their dynamic regulation modulate neuronal excitability, communications, and plasticity in the brain.Ion channels are pore-forming proteins that generate electric current by mediating the flow of ions across the plasma membrane in morphologically and functionally distinct neuronal compartments called axons and dendrites. Axons generate and propagate action potentials whereas dendrites receive them at inter-cellular junctions called synapses where synaptic transmissions (communications) occur between neurons.Ion channel dysregulation is involved in a wide variety of neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. In Chung lab, we focus on epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Epilepsy is a common chronic brain disorder caused by excessive brain activity clinically characterized as seizures, which are abnormal and uncontrolled discharges of electrical signals in the brain cells called neurons. Drug-resistant seizures have severe consequences including cognitive decline, high mortality rate, psychiatric disorders, neurodevelopmental delay, and brain damage. Hence, better understanding of the pathogenesis of epilepsy is critical to develop novel therapeutic interventions and early diagnostics for epilepsy. A fundamental question is “how do neurons change themselves to produce excessive electrical signals in an epileptic brain compared to a normal brain?”",

        "description": "Abstract: Fermi surfaces have a number of fascinating properties, including a continuum of gapless excitations, a landscape of possible collective modes, universal super-area law entanglement, and relevant deformations that can produce non-Fermi liquid quantum critical metals. Their extreme gaplessness makes them difficult to tame with the conventional tools of QFT. Bosonization provides a potential nonperturbative approach by describing Fermi surface dynamics through a collective field living on a part of phase space. However, while such a field is sensible semiclassically, the challenge of treating it quantum mechanically has prevented bosonization from providing as powerful a tool as in one dimension. I will show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a particular large N limit of a U(N)_1 WZW model, with a tower of irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom in the collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches.",

        "description": "In fourteenth-century Provence, the volume of contracts produced by scribes known as public notaries increased rapidly from thousands each year to millions. By the fifteenth century, virtually all social and economic relations could be guaranteed by a notarial act. Reliance on the written word expanded both geographically and socially, reaching even the region's most remote rural communities and serving the interests of marginalized actors, including women, peasants, and religious minorities. This talk seeks to answer fundamental questions about this extraordinary moment in late medieval law, literacy, and technology: Why did written records become so wildly popular so quickly? What were the consequences of this rapid legal and cultural transformation? And how did the lives and logics of everyday legal actors change as a result?",

        "description": "vanessa german is a leading citizen artist working in sculpture, performance, and communal ritual to cultivate spiritual models for transforming human experience. Establishing her own self-taught approach and distinctive artistic language, german’s influential practice employs mineral crystals, beads, glass, found objects, and other sourced material to create expressive figurative sculptures that resound through the physical and metaphysical worlds. Her unique sculptural vocabulary transmits healing energy, affirming the power of love as an infinite human technology. Channeling precolonial and African diasporic traditions, her figures allude to the Kongo nkisi nkondi, each charged by the protective and restorative spirits that complement their physical materials. Guided by her own creativity, imagination and curiosity, german follows her intuition about the capacity for objects to tell stories, creating sculptures that resonate deeply with those who encounter them. The artist’s practice is intertwined with her history of activism and community leadership. Crediting her mother, the fiber artist Sandra Keat German, with inspiring her sense of creative purpose, german realized her first power figures on the front porch of her home, where she would invite neighbors to join her. She would soon found the arts initiative Love Front Porch in 2011 before establishing ARThouse, combining a community studio and artist residency for her neighbors, in 2014. german has received numerous accolades over the course of her career, including the Joyce Foundation Fellowship (2024), Heinz Award for the Arts (2022), Don Tyson Prize from the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (2018), United States Artist Grant (2018), Jacob Lawrence Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2017) and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Grant (2015).",

        "description": "Based on findings of a long-term ethnographic study of the integration and other experiences of Bosnians resettled as refugees to two urban environments in the north of New York State, this talk will suggest taking a long-term perspective in studying refugee integration. While the labels \"pre-resettlement\" and \"post-resettlement\" offer analytical convenience when examining this topic, it is helpful to recognize that the integrating individuals may not necessarily be operating on a logic that divides their lives in a \"before-and-after\" manner. Accordingly, the talk will invite attention to the ways in which integration experiences may exhibit a nonlinear or cyclical character. Factors such as difficulties of exit from the origin country and transit through subsequent countries later on may impact individual or collective decision-making in areas of, for instance, home buying in the permanent resettlement country. Likewise, the availability of transferable pre-migration soft & hard skills and capital may lead to variations in naturalization decisions, entrepreneurial activities, and community building initiatives of refugees who may otherwise be similarly positioned in terms of ethno-national-religious backgrounds, reasons for displacement, and types of assistance received, among other attributes.Fethi Keles, PT Instructor, Department of Anthropology, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University",

This leads to unmasking of target EHF cues, which could help listeners identify the target talker. Children’s greater sensitivity at EHFs and reliance on greater signal bandwidth could make EHF cues especially useful for children. In this talk I will present preliminary findings from a study where adult and child listeners were tested on their sensitivity to the relative head orientations of talkers in a multi-talker scene.",

        "description": "Please join this two part seminar. All are welcome to stay after the seminar for informal networking with the the center team.MASTERS: Multisensory VR Environments to Train First Responders under Emotional StressThe MASTERS project brings together a transdisciplinary consortium spanning computer science, HCI, mechanics, philosophy, cognitive sciences, and medicine to design innovative training methods for first responders (law enforcement officers, firefighters, emergency medical staff, etc.). Its central goal is to support them in maintaining self-control under high-stress conditions, whether the constraints are psychological, social, or situational.Building on field studies, the project aims to develop a multisensory, immersive, and collaborative VR training program that realistically simulates socio-emotional situations. The presentation will first provide an overview of the project and its methodological approach before turning to the key challenges in designing such environments, including interpersonal haptic interactions, user representations, and interactions with virtual agents, elements that are critical to ensuring realism and training efficiency.Speaker:Amine Chellali received his M.Sc. in Robotics from École Centrale de Nantes (France) in 2005 and his Ph.D. in HCI from the University of Nantes (France) in 2009. From 2009 to 2011, he worked as a research assistant at the IRCCyN Lab. He then moved to the U.S. to work as a postdoctoral associate at Tufts University in the EREL Lab from 2011 to 2012 and then as a research associate in the ISSyL lab at Harvard Medical School. Currently, he is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Evry Paris-Saclay (France) and co-leader of the Interaction, Mixed Reality, and Assistive Robotics (IRA2) research group at the IBISC Lab. His research interests include Simulator fidelity, Haptic interactions, Collaborative virtual environments, and the transfer and evaluation of human skills. The main applications are in the field of medical training. He has received several grants for his research on VR simulation from the French National Research Agency and other national funding sources. Emotion Analysis and Empathic Adaptation in Immersive Scenarios: Toward Ethically Informed Human Understanding and EngagementThis research first explores the use of adaptive immersive scenarios to enhance human understanding and engagement in different contexts. The models combine ontologies, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) to produce stressful scenarios for training first responders. These scenarios are personalized according to each user’s profile, accounting for individual vulnerabilities—such as empathy, sensitivity to authority, or stress triggers—to create ethically informed and effective experiences.Building on this concept of user-centered scenario design, the ITS-STORY project investigates the use of mixed reality to foster historical empathy. Focusing on the Royallieu Camp Memorial in Compiègne, the project examines how immersive technologies can renew public engagement with the history of internment and deportation during the Second World War. Among the projects's objectives is the adaptation of immersive scenarios to participants' empathic responses, enabling personalized and ethically sensitive experiences that foster deeper historical understanding while avoiding exaggerated emotional engagement.Within this framework, the research focuses on the detection and quantification of empathy through facial emotion recognition using computer vision and machine learning. The aim is to understand whether empathic responses—elicited by historically grounded virtual scenarios—can be inferred from emotional cues. Building on multiple iterations of facial emotion recognition models, the work has evolved toward explainable approaches, combining deep learning architectures with SHAP-based interpretability analyses.This presentation addresses the adaptive design of scenarios according to user responses, details the methodological framework for measuring empathy through facial emotion analysis, and discusses ongoing challenges in linking emotional and empathic responses in immersive memorial environments. Together, these initiatives highlight the potential of personalized immersive experiences to enhance both professional training and public engagement and demonstrate how measuring emotional and empathic responses can inform ethically sensitive scenario design.Speakers:Domitile Lourdeaux is Full Professor at the CNRS Heudiasyc UMR 7253 laboratory at the Université de technologie de Compiègne UTC – Alliance Sorbonne University. Since 1997, she has been conducting research on Artificial Intelligence based Virtual Environments.Since 2019, she has been coordinator of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Speciality at UTC. She has coordinated and participated in numerous projects: H2020 INFINITY (European police cooperation for criminal investigations), 2020-2024 ANR VICTEAMS (2014-2019 training of teams to rescue injured people), MacCoy Critical (2014-2019 training non-technical skills in critical situations), and SAGECE (2008-2010 training in crisis management following NRBCE terrorist attacks) to name a few.Insaf Setitra is an Associate Professor in the CNRS Heudiasyc UMR 7253 laboratory at the Université de technologie de Compiègne UTC – Alliance Sorbonne University.

        "description": "The RBML is thrilled to host Gillen D’Arcy Wood, who will speak about his new book, The Wake of HMS Challenger: How a Legendary Victorian Voyage Tells the Story of Our Oceans' Decline. Copies of the book will be available for purchase and signing. This event is free and open to the public, and refreshments will be served.In December 1872, HMS Challenger embarked on the first round-the-world oceanographic expedition. Its goal: to shine a light for the first time on the mysteries of the deep sea. For the next four years, Challenger’s naturalists explored the oceans, encountering never-before-seen marvels of marine life. The expedition’s achievements are the stuff of legend. It identified major ocean currents and defining features of the seafloor, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Mariana Trench. It measured worldwide sea temperatures and chemistry, creating baseline data for all ocean research since. And, most spectacularly of all, it collected nearly five thousand sea creatures and plants new to science. In The Wake of HMS Challenger, Gillen D’Arcy Wood looks afresh at this legendary scientific odyssey and shows why, 150 years later, its legacy looms larger than ever.The Challenger’s scientists had no way of knowing that the incredible undersea aquarium they were documenting was on the verge of catastrophic change. Off Portugal, they encountered a brilliant starfish now threatened with extinction by microplastics; in St. Thomas, teeming coral habitats that today have been decimated by ocean warming; and at remote Ascension Island, the breeding grounds of the now-endangered green turtle. Lyrical and elegiac, The Wake of HMS Challenger offers a stunning before-and-after picture of our global oceans. It is both a reminder of what we have lost since the Victorian age and an urgent call to preserve what remains of the diverse life and wild beauty of our planet’s final frontier.",

        "description": "This study explores the role of critical thinking in fostering resistance to misinformation and its influence on intentions to verify information and share content on social media. Using a national survey (N=928) in the U.S., the findings indicate that individuals with strong critical thinking skills are more likely to verify information they encounter on social media and less likely to share unverified content. These relationships are mediated by greater perceived threat of misinformation and more positive attitudes toward fact-checking. The results highlight the significance of cultivating critical thinking skills as a key strategy to strengthen public resilience against misinformation. Here is a little bit about Dr. Sang-Hwa Oh:  https://media.illinois.edu/oh-sang-hwa/Feel free to bring a brown bag lunch!",

Through an examination of Hindu Sanskrit literary works and royal architectural sites, I investigate how landscapes, literary productions, and imagined identities mutually contributed to the production of political power and religious authority for the royal court of Mewar. This is the first ever study of several major Sanskrit literary works, including inscriptions and textual narratives, emerging from the kingdom of Mewar during the medieval period.Adam Newman is the co-director of Graduate Studies and Assistant Professor in the Department of Religion at the University of Illinois.

        "description": "A Time for the Province proposes innovative readings of historical and contemporary Polish borderlands as a complex dialogic zone, offering new ways of connecting the Polish past(s) with the country’s present and its future. Across seven chapters, as the study dives into narratives by some of Poland’s most iconic modern authors, including the 2018 Nobel Laureate Olga Tokarczuk, it engages with fields of memory and postmemory studies, postsocialist studies, Holocaust history, Jewish-Polish relations, and ethnic and migration studies. Drawing on writings of such contemporary Polish critics as Przemysław Czapliński and Krzysztof Czyżewski, postcolonial theorists including Homi Bhabha and Edward Said, and philosophers of the human environment such as Gaston Bachelard, A Time for the Province revises and complicates traditional conceptions of what the province and the borderland represent and perform within Polish literary and cultural practice, reframing this space as both a contact zone and a palimpsest.George Gasyna is Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures and Comparative and World Literature at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and editor in chief of the Slavic & East European Journal (SEEJ). Born in Łódź, Poland, he and his family emigrated to Ontario, Canada – home of one of the largest and most vibrant Polish diasporas in North America – when he was 12. Prof. Gasyna holds a BA and an MA in Russian and Slavic Studies from McGill University in Montreal, and a PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of Toronto (2005). Specializing in Polish literature of the 20th century, his work engages with a number of adjacent fields including émigré and exilic discourses, heritage and diaspora studies, and Polish-Jewish relations, as well as travel writing and memoir. Prof. Gasyna is author of Polish, Hybrid, and Otherwise: Exilic Discourse in Joseph Conrad and Witold Gombrowicz (London: Bloomsbury, 2011), and editor for the volume of essays Joseph Conrad’s Polish Soul: Realms of Memory and Self (2016). His scholarship has appeared in a number of critical collections and journals including Slavic Review, Canadian Slavonic Papers, Polish Review, and Russian Literature. His most recent book, A Time for the Province: Palimpsests and Borders in Twentieth-Century Polish Literature, was published in spring 2025 by McGill-Queen's University Press.",

For example, a major class of questions in genomics aim to identify and understand the latent biological factors underlying observed high-throughput molecular readouts. Representation learning techniques from computer science offer a powerful solution. I will describe three methods we have developed, in response to new problems arising from recently developed spatial genomics technologies, that leverage manifold learning, network embedding, sparse matrix decomposition, and causal representation learning. I will then highlight additional areas ripe for new ideas. Bio:Dave Zhao is an Associate Professor of Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His research focuses on nonparametric empirical Bayes methods, high-dimensional statistics, and statistical genomics. He is also the Director of Computational Genomics at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, where he leads initiatives to identify, initiate, and develop cutting-edge collaborations between computational and biological researchers.Part of the Siebel School Speakers Series.

Dealing with the silences of the archive – the voices and identities written out of history – requires new and innovative tools, and in this talk she surveys the many different approaches she has taken across her fiction and non-fiction writing to recover women: from deep analysis of Greek texts to popular contemporary myth retellings to innovative takes on history that mix fact and fiction to uncover new ways of knowing. Join her on an adventure across time and the tools of history to re-discover the women of the ancient world.Copies of Hauser's recent books Penelope’s Bones: A New History of Homer’s World through the Women Written Out of It and How Women Became Poets: A Gender History of Greek Literature will be available onsite for purchase and signing.

        "description": "Abstract: Quantum computing and sensing represent two distinct frontiers of quantum information science. Here, we harness quantum computing to solve a fundamental and practically important sensing problem: the detection of weak oscillating fields with unknown strength and frequency. We present a quantum computing enhanced sensing protocol, that we dub quantum search sensing, outperforming all existing approaches. Furthermore, we prove our approach is optimal by establishing the Grover-Heisenberg limit -- a fundamental lower bound on the minimum sensing time. The key idea is to robustly digitize the continuous, analog signal into a discrete operation, which is then integrated into a quantumalgorithm. Our metrological gain originates from quantum computation, distinguishing our protocol from conventional sensing approaches. Indeed, we prove that broad classes of protocols based on quantum Fisher information, finite-lifetime quantum memory, or classical signal processing are strictly less powerful. We propose and analyze a proof-of-principle experiment using nitrogen-vacancy centers, where meaningful improvements are achievable using current technology. This work establishes quantum computation as a powerful new resource for advancing sensing capabilities. Bio: Soonwon Choi is a Victor F. Weisskopf Career Development Assistant Professor of Physics at MIT, whose research is focused on quantum information science and technology and its applications for studying out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Choi completed his undergraduate study in physics at Caltech in 2012, got his PhD degree in physics from Harvard University in 2018. Then he worked as a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley before joining MIT as an assistant professor in July 2021.    To watch online, go to the IQUIST YouTube channel:   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCzAySwQXF8J4kRolUzg2ww",

        "description": "Defects as Foe or Friend: The Development of Silicon Carbide from Nuclear Batteries to Quantum SensorsAbstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is well suited for radiation sensing in harsh environments due to its wide bandgap (3.2 eV for 4H-SiC), strong radiation tolerance, and high-temperature resilience. There are still many untapped research topics in this area: high-temperature applications, fast neutron detection for fission and fusion systems, use as an alternative to silicon for low-energy X-ray detection, SiC avalanche photodiodes for UV light detection, nuclear batteries, and even emerging work in quantum sensing due to its spin defects and potential for lab-on-chip device integration. In this talk, I will present our work on developing SiC for alpha spectroscopy, demonstrating performance up to 500 °C, its application in nuclear batteries, and our initial efforts toward quantum sensors for reactor dose monitoring, as well as future directions for MeV neutron detection. This seminar is also given as an IEEE NPSS Distinguished Lecture. Bio:  Dr. L. Raymond Cao is a Professor and Director of the Nuclear Engineering Program at The Ohio State University (OSU), where he has also served as Director of the OSU Nuclear Reactor Laboratory since 2016.

        "description": "Join us for a lecture in the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age Speaker Series with Tara Isabella Burton. God-making: Magic and Transhumanism from the Renaissance to the Digital AgeAre we building God? In an era where artificial intelligence and the ubiquity of the Internet age renders the realm of information more present -- and real-feeling -- than the physical one, how do we understand ourselves theologically? And, no less importantly, how do we understand our relationship to reality? This talk will explore contemporary transhumanism -- from human self-transcendence to the rise of artificial intelligence -- as a specifically theological phenomenon, one rooted in the symbol set, rhetoric, and sacralization of the human found in the Western esoteric tradition. Often considered under the catch-all term \"magic,\" or \"learned magic,\" these schools of thought -- rooted in late antique Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Hermeticism, and frequently revived by scientists and humanists from Marsilio Ficino to Isaac Newton -- stress the necessity of human beings using gnosis to become Gods and perhaps even transcend their creature. This lecture will show the perennial influence of these ideas at various stages of what we now think of as \"modernity\", as well as their impact, in particular, on the twentieth-century counterculture that gave rise to the Internet.     About the SpeakerTara Isabella Burton is the author of Strange Rites: New Religions for a Godless World, Self-Made: Creating Our Identities from Da Vinci to the Kardashians, and the novels Social Creature, The World Cannot Give, and Here in Avalon. About the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital AgeHoused in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, the Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age supports study and research into the possibilities for human flourishing in contemporary society.The activities of the Forum combine philosophical reflection on human nature and the human good with practical reflection on the possibilities for living well, and for designing tools that contribute to human flourishing, in a world shaped by digital technology.

        "description": "Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect, driven by strong correlations in Landau levels, has long stood as a paradigm of emergent topological order and fractionalized quasiparticles with potential applications in quantum computation. A long-standing goal has been to realize its zero-field counterpart, the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, which is predicted to arise in topological flat bands through interaction-induced breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Here we report the observation of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. At zero magnetic field, in addition to a C = 1 quantum anomalous Hall state, we observe eleven fractionally quantized Hall resistance plateaus Rxy=h/(νe2) at filling factors including ν=2/3, 3/5, 4/7… 4/9, 3/7, and 1/3. Near half-filling, the Hall resistance varies linearly with carrier density and approaches Rxy=2h/e2, reminiscent of the composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Landau level. Most notably, further experiments reveal the coexistence of FQAH states, electron crystallization, and superconductivity at lower electron temperatures. Together, these results establish rhombohedral graphene moiré superlattices as a versatile platform for realizing exotic correlated topological phases and for exploring quasiparticles with fractional statistics, ultimately advancing toward non-Abelian anyons, key building blocks for universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation.",
